### The Big Principle: 
### In mercantilism, that "father figure" you have that told you "it is not about the money, it is about the principle" might just rape you dead and take all of your belongings...

Business comes and goes, much more frequently than governments. 
So how can commerce thrive without the dread of disillusionment
that stems from the lackluster payoff in zero-sum dynamics? 
Zero-sum dynamics carry an extremely bipolar nature in the 
psychology of actors. And there are few paradigms of thought 
outside of this zero-sum strategic convention in politics, 
business, and war. Well, to clarify, there are few paradigms 
of thought, outside of zero-sum, that have gained enough 
mainstream adoption for the concepts to be taught in typical 
higher education settings.

Brilliance does not quite make the mark in intensely competitive 
settings. But there are some that argue that it is the misuse 
of brilliance, trained and primed towards "malfeasant" outlets,
that results in clear defeats for the owner/s of that brilliance. 
But there have been and are plenty of brilliant people that 
did not quite train and prime themselves towards "malfeasant" 
outlets. And they get paid in dirt. The dumb and perhaps 
retarded scoff at their ideas, deny their promotion, and ruin 
their composure. This is how some brilliant people get treated
like dirt. They get invited to a club or party of some high-society
members, after achieving much and expecting some festive recognition, 
and the invites are rescinded. And the club/party mentions them as if 
they are some dull one fit for exploitation. The high-society 
members already know, due to the luxury and power that they 
are able to retain, that preventative measures against 
exploitation require more than just brilliance. Brilliance 
is materially less in value than dirt. The brilliant person 
wants to get somewhere, with rejection thrown in their face 
as well as insults and knives in their back, their so-called 
"defensive posturing" against exploitation is most definitely 
born from a source, or at least an effect, of malice. 

Do you really think that fat cow that is your neighbor really 
gives a care for your interests and well-being? Laissez-faire 
feudalism predicts that they do not. While you might be digging 
trenches for "modern-day Rome", that fat cow, the one that has 
never been hurt in any way except for their feelings, looks at
you like you are some kind of slave. The fat cow is stupid.
It is stupid not because it is simple-minded. It is stupid for 
judging while sitting comfortably in its welfare zone, sponsored 
by the government in the name of ... what? Merit? Justice? That
fat cow, ultimately in the context of economic sacrifice, may 
as well be a wolf. It may as well be a wolf because it would 
prefer that you are eaten instead of it.

Suppose there is some kind of wisdom in ultra-competitive 
environments, borne out of Laissez-faire, that goes something 
similar as "one should make as much effort in befriending 
another as the effort required to defend against an enemy."
This is an "ideal" that is much easier to declare and believe in 
than to successfully accomplish. The difficulty of accomplishing
this "ideal" rests upon the nature that surrounds the center, 
for there is no mechanical principle behind it that ensures 
the equal probability of easiness in befriending and enemizing.
Who is to state, with a guarantee that rests completely on 
confidence instead of fear, that not every person becomes 
an enemy in the eyes of a "neo-mercantilist" (for lack of a 
better term)? 

The notion of the fat cow as a wolf in the context of 
economic sacrifice is a strong assumption on costs from 
loss due to some underlying fatalism. Rest assured that 
there are many in academia and government that strongly 
disagree with the concept of competition, or at least 
self-improvement, as zero-sum. These contrarian views 
harness the game theory specification of "non-zero sum 
games". The rationale is that some aspects, which can be
quantified, rests on a sort of cooperation, a mutual 
assurance, a compromise. There is much opinion and 
exemplification on non-zero sum games. These so-called 
"games" do exist in reality, but were only formalized 
into theoretical frameworks, for re-teaching, sometime 
in the last two centuries. By the standard of non-zero 
sum games, the fat cow does not have to be a wolf then! 

The mechanics of "costs", including but not limited to 
quantitative finance, are derived from the cultural 
mores and collective ambition, but the "faith" in these 
numbers do not rest on a uniform consensus of agreement. 
For instance, a sentimental person would probably prefer 
to sell something else other than the memorabilia 
that they've acquired through their years. There is 
the belief in the pricelessness of some material 
objects. Collectively, these same material objects 
could very well be circulated by the masses, according 
to some arbitrarily-set standard of valuation, if 
they are to land in their hands. There are psychological 
and collectivist elements in non-zero sum games. Suppose
that two agents are participants in such a game. Given 
the perceived costs in this game's cost table, the two 
agents "cooperate" for outcomes that grant them both 
"positive" gains, by the table's objective numbers. But
there is dissatisfaction underneath the compromise. 
Perhaps either one or both of the agents feel as though
they deserve more of the "positive" gains. What factors 
would ensure that for the next "game" these two agents 
participate in, there would be no disagreement on the
values of said game's cost table? On the matter of 
collectivist elements in non-zero sum games, suppose
that two arbitrary agents are enthusiastic participants. 
Both of them are practically in sync, with regards to 
their decisions and the corresponding payoffs from those
decisions. But regardless of what decisions they made,
there is a "super-agent" above them. This "super-agent"
is the singular representative of the collective outside
of the game's two agents. According to the facts given 
to this super-agent, both of the agents lose in the 
non-zero sum game. The deceptively "positive" gains split
between the two agents are in fact losses to them. Perhaps
the gains could have been objectively greater if the 
agents were to participate in non-zero sum games without
the overhead of the super-agent's authority. Perhaps
the gains are not objectively positive gains for the
two agents in the long term, given the super-agent's 
influence and capability of intervening between the 
two. 

Cultural, psychological, and collectivistic factors 
were especially noted in non-zero sum games, even
though their existence in zero-sum games is not 
negligible. It is obvious to state that zero-sum 
games, if based on accurate cost tables, result 
in "cleaner cuts". Every participant has very 
little motive to consider the outcome of well-being
for their "competitors". Zero-sum games rest on 
the principles of physics. Value cannot grow, but 
it can be cleanly transferred from some original 
owner, a participant in the zero-sum game, to 
another. The argument that zero-sum games are 
more objectively-based than non-zero sum games 
is more persuasive than the argument for vice-versa.

There is an absolute chance for arguments that non-zero
sum games are more amenable to participants. And the 
claim that the base of objectivity is an exclusive 
trait to zero-sum games is surely to be scrutinized. 
There is another claim that can be more fully 
agreed upon: for any prolonged sequence of 
decision-making events, the usage of both 
game categories serve unique demands. The payoffs 
to participants from non-zero sum games may amount 
to less for each, in comparison to the potential 
payoff (single participant gain) from zero-sum games.
But over time, the partial payoffs from each 
non-zero sum game produce longer lasting and more
stable benefits to the participants, by the metrics 
revolving around uniformity and the mean. Needless to 
say, these two categories of games can be expanded to
involve more than two agents in the lens of mass 
organization. Organizations do not tend to encourage
zero-sum games between its members, given the condition
that both members are of pertinence, through utility, to 
the organization (but perhaps not of the same degree). 
The compromise from non-zero sum games suits the purpose
of pacifying such biases, including jealousy and ambition, 
for integrity of the organization. However, in an 
organization's life, there occur instances where 
zero-sum games are utilized for the objective of 
slashing what is deemed to be excess or vice. 

The first paragraph of this essay posits the 
domineering influence of zero-sum, over others, such as 
the alternative of non-zero sum, as a concept taught
in the education setting. Many in university/government
settings would probably not be vocal in support of this
posit. Activities such as research&development, 
coordinated security, and journal publications do 
lean toward cost values of non-zero sum game. 
Knowledge, especially, is one of the fundamental 
possessions that do not operate on zero-sum dynamics 
on the one condition that the knowledge is fairly
distributed. One of the ideals espoused in higher 
education is something along the lines of "a more 
informed society is a superior society". But the 
value of knowledge wildly oscillates from trivia 
to critical vulnerabilities belonging to persons, 
organizations, nation-states, etc. What is a non-zero
sum game to a select group of participants may be
reflected onto another group as a zero-sum game's 
outcome that adversely affects them.

With regards to application of the concepts zero or
non-zero sum, the first is predominantly used in 
contexts such as material transfers and clear-cut
win/lose outcomes. Due to the cooperative nature 
of non-zero sum games, even with the specification 
that the participants do not know ahead of time 
what their counterparts' decisions are, there is 
a tendency for at least one of the participants 
to lose sight of the definition behind the outcome
values. The coupling (two participants) and 
entanglement (more than two participants) fuzz 
decision-making in such a way for there to be 
virtually no optimum payoff by the available 
options. Perhaps in some cases, contiguous 
non-zero sum games played by the participants 
may result for there to be a kind of "delegation"
from at least one of the players to the remainder.
The preferences of the remainder become prioritized
over the delegators, who would rather play and follow
along than to emphasize their own ideal choices 
in the "game". 

## Autonomy and Games

Autonomy is a multi-faceted question in arrangements 
that are games. Why would an agent participate in some 
arrangement called a game if there is the certainty 
that the best outcome, in the form of payoffs from 
the true cost table, cannot result in their betterment?
The agent diverges from their original circumstances
that would have granted them opportunities to pursue 
some desired sequence of outcomes, each a checkpoint of 
success or at least, gratification. Then they are 
enmeshed in circumstances that require their actions 
to be geared towards some objective directly related 
to the specific temporal demands of those circumstances.
They can mention the question of choice, a topic which 
is generally known to many members of societies that have 
had their hands forced into certain outlets (certainly by 
the mortal powers above them), but they will only receive
a response to accept the matter as another of idealism's
lost visions.

Children engage in activities that can be termed
as "games". These activities generally do no harm amongst
themselves, and give them the benefit of developing their
values and way of life to eventually play the roles of 
astute cogs in mature society. It is this premise that 
is a major moral justification for why some find themselves
in circumstances, deemed games by some, that they otherwise
would not engage in, either due to their ignorance that 
such circumstances (comprised of materials and events) exist 
or their involuntary stance towards those circumstances.
The premise as one word is education. Is this word 
simply a transmission of terminology and procedures,
as well as the auxiliary materials used to aid in 
understanding and experiencing this transmission of 
information? Could education really be as simple as two 
parallel straight paths, one the perfect transmission 
(by the educator) and the other the perfect practice or 
at least the most genuine effort in practice (by the educatee)? 

Entertain the notion that there are two tenets in education. 
For matters of fact, education transmits absolute truth. 
And for other matters, education transmits perfect knowledge 
of the methodology. This notion relies on the condition that
there is nothing to be educated on past the minds of the 
educators. The educators were selected due to their mastery 
of the matters that they are to transmit and train their 
educatees on. So the educators could not possibly steer
any of their subjects directly towards wrongful practices 
and fallacies. 

On the idea of autonomy as the choice to participate
in games that benefit and to not participate in anti-beneficial
games, education as outlined by the previous paragraph 
is beneficial. But in games that are believed not to be
beneficial, how can an agent truly know that they will 
sorely pay during or after their participation? Couple 
the particular outlining of education (in the previous 
paragraph) with active efforts to know the unknown (and 
all of the unknown's costs), from a perspective that supercedes
even the educator. And the resultant is not education by 
the definition. Instead, it is experimentation and education. 
Education systems can enable their educatees to experiment, 
outside of constraints designed by the educator.
There are certainly arguments available to defend these 
kinds of education systems, so that the educatees have 
greater awareness of what games will pay them off 
immensely, what other games are non-profit but greatly
expands the experience (if experience cannot be 
quantified), and yet still the remaining games that 
will make them sorely pay beyond their recovery back to 
growth or at least, stasis. 

The structuralization of any education system surely 
cannot accomodate the demands of the lifelong learner.
This is to assume that any education system imposes
binding demands on its participants. Without binding
demands, the freedom of participants to come and go 
by their own volition somehow dilutes the seriousness
and truthfulness of the informational material 
transmitted to them. In these circumstances, education
becomes casual recreation, and recreation is personally
experiential events; this is a Dionysian VS Apollonion 
argument. Even if one is not keen on learning any more 
past their depth, there is still the requirement 
of experience in sentient existence (if life goes on). 
And experience can be very stochastic, or even worse, 
engineered against those subject to the experience. The 
term "information-flow system" suffices as a superset 
of "education system". There are not required to be any 
binding demands from an educator that does not need to 
exist. The omnipresent requirement of processing 
information stands strong in this superset of an 
education system, even stronger than that of the 
education system since the lack of structured guidance 
is compensated by utter seriousness in certain contexts.

In many respects, the objective of education is to 
enhance and refine risk-averse mentalities and behaviors.
For example, mistakes from history should not be repeated.
Make careful calculations before embarking on dangerous
trails. Take the tragic lessons from literature to heart.
And so on. With experimentation, there is risk attached.
Experimentation is interesting with regards to 
accountability. Educators generally steer clear from 
the losses from experimentation. The simple more is that
they cannot risk their reputation to become entangled 
in what are perceived by third-party judges as fallibility 
traps. The fact that there are different natures and 
styles attached to those that experiment validates the 
anticipation that conceptualizations of fallibility, such 
as the Seven Deadly Sins, are to be mentioned by some in 
their aims to "reveal and penalize evil". 

Autonomy is intricately connected to information-flow
systems. Some important attributes of noteworthy mention
are filtration processes, recognition mechanisms, flow 
control, network administration, and ultimately, capabilities 
past the knowledge that is perfect information.

## Situational Engineering

The academic field of game theory has mass-proliferated
some important findings in the context of decision-making.
It has structured "games", decision-making junctions between 
two or more agents, into these classifications: strategic, 
extensive, and coalitional. It has also put focus on the 
nature of information available to agents during their 
activities called "games", that is, perfect and imperfect 
information. Rules for calculating the optimal decision
are defined by the Nash equilibrium and its sibling 
concepts. In cases where there is no optimum by the decisions
and costs granted to the agents, there is also the 
"ideal" (or expectation) of steady state, as illustrated
by games such as Matching Pennies. 

The mathematics applied in game theory is extensive enough 
to satisfy these two big questions: 
- best decisions or expected states,
- expected payoffs (through probabilistic functions or 
best-decision rules). 

But what about the situation? Given merely the cost tables 
(as formulated by game theory), some agents are predisposed
to having some set of moves that may or may not intersect
with the movesets of their co-participants. In other words,
there is an unspoken asymmetry or equality in capabilities
before the consideration of the game in focus. Acceptance of
these conditions relies on the acceptance of the histories
(for lack of a better term) of not only the agents belonging
to the game in focus. There is also the need to understand 
the outside factors, some of which may be responsible for 
governing past events, agents, interpretations, and orders 
into the situation that contains the participating agents. 

Consider this situation, called Game of Varying Coercion. 
There are only two players to make way for simplicity of 
illustration.

| t=1 | Play Along | Reveal |
| --- | ---------- | ------ |
| Silent Trigger | 10,1 | 10,-100 |
| Brute's Force | -1,0 | 5,-50 |

**GVC1:** Game of Varying Coercion @ timestamp 1; (2 x 2).

Agent A (row-wise) has the clear upper hand, in terms of
cost as quantified by this table. Agent B is put into a
servile position. Agent A would be wise to maintain 
preference for the dominated action of Silent Trigger.
There is no possibility for Silent Trigger to inflict 
negative gains for Agent A. Whether Agent B chooses to
obey Agent A by playing along, or revealing so as to 
catalyze revolt against Agent A, Agent A secures its 
upper hand by Silent Trigger. For Agent A to act by 
Brute's Force against an obedient Agent B speaks poorly 
for its welfare, as denoted by the negative gain of 
-1. If Brute's Force is used against Agent B in the 
case of its act of revealing, then there is a positive 
gain of half that for Silent Trigger. Suppose the 
revelation is judged to be fallacious, so much that 
Brute's Force is justified.  

Silent Trigger requires more skill by the actor. It
also requires more situational expenses so that the
silence of the Trigger is not exposed to Agent B or
third-party observers, who then have more knowledge 
and material to retaliate. The cost values of Table GVC1
denote the combative gains by the agents. However, 
there is another set of costs that are pertinent, 
by Table ST1. 

| ~~ | Effective Cooperative | Ineffective Cooperative |
| --- | ---------- | ------ |
| Bull's Eye | -3,-12 | -1000,-50 |
| Missed Mark | -30,-100 | -1200,-1000 |

**ST1:** Costs to Resources by Silent Trigger; (2 x 2).

There are two possibilities for the actor behind Silent 
Trigger, labeled by the rows. The infrastructural costs, 
comprised of sentient agents, the environment, and the 
situation that is staged by these sentient agents, are 
the two columns: effective and ineffective cooperative. 
The cooperative is designated as an alignment with the 
Silent Trigger's actor. Note that there are no positive
gains to resources. If the cooperative is ineffective, 
whether voluntarily or not, then it is critical for 
Silent Trigger's actor to move by Bull's Eye, in the 
name of costs to resources. If there is effective 
cooperative, the event of Missed Mark by Silent Trigger's 
actor results in less damage to resources. Table ST1 
illustrates the heavy costs, even without the risk of 
failure by Silent Trigger's actor and their cooperative, 
of maintaining the dominated action of Silent Trigger 
over Brute's Force. 

By Brute's Force, however, there is a risk that 
oppositional mass-organization from Agent B 
(in Table GVC1) ensues. The situation of the involved 
agents can escalate into something similar to that 
illustrated below.

| ~~ | Advance Opposition | Maintain Opposition | Withdraw Opposition |
| --- | -------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------- | 
| Escalate Brute's Force | 1000,500 | 250,250 | 2000,0 | 
| Mix Brute's Force with Silent Trigger | 2000,-50 | 1000,500 | 2000,-300
| Silent Trigger | 0,400 | 0,0 | 4000,-200

**BFAM:** Combative Gains (Opponent's Pay) in the Aftermath of Initial Brute's Force; (3 x 3).

Table BFAM gives numbers that still predominantly benefit Agent A.
But these numbers are based only the starting states of the agents, 
and shed no evidence on the constancy of costs over repeated iterations.
Brute's Force may result in the situation of Table BFAM, and the decision 
for Agent A to choose Brute's Force over Silent Trigger may be due to 
the latter's unsuccessful enactment, which in turn, is due to the 
negative gains. Silent Trigger in BFAM, due to its requirements of 
high skill and effective cooperative, becomes virtually useless 
unless Agent B chooses to withdraw opposition. 

The Game of Varying Coercion is an antagonistic game. It 
requires for there to be an aggressive antagonist and an 
incapable subordinate target, with much less the social and 
communicative resources than available to its opposer. What 
kind of game is this, for there to be irrationality on the 
part of Agent B that results in its entering this situation? 
Game theoretics do presuppose that agents act by rational 
choice, before, during, and after any arbitrary decision 
junction that is a game. As stated in the beginning of this 
section, the rationale for why situations such as Game of 
Varying Coercion occur is essentially long, nuanced, 
specific explanations based on histories. A more civilized 
version of this game can certainly exist, as Game of 
Pacified Varying Coercion. 

| t=1 | Genuinely Cooperate | Civil Re-negotiation | Fraud/Betrayal |
| --- | ------------------- | -------------------- | -------------- |
| Pacified Silent Trigger | 100,100 | 0,0 | 1000,0 |
| Pacified Brute's Force | -1000,0 | -100,500 | 1000,0 |

**GPVC1:** Game of Pacified Varying Coercion @ timestamp 1; (2 X 3).

There is the question of the degree of choice 
revolving around the hands (of the agents and third-parties) 
in the Game of Varying Coercion. Would it not be splendid if
there was only the alternative of Game of Pacified Varying 
Coercion to be played? There would be little motive for any 
rational Agent B to choose Fraud/Betrayal. The integrity of 
the feedback loops involving genuine cooperation and civil 
re-negotiations would lead to a continuous improvement 
process, without any second thoughts. But back to the matter 
of the Game of Varying Coercion, it could be argued that 
the events leading up to the asymmetric attributes of the 
involved players are essentially sibling decision junctions 
of the Game of Chicken. The key difference is that in the 
Game of Chicken, the objective is mirror-opposite decisions. 
To achieve the moveset of Agent A in Game of Varying Coercion,
as a game before this game, there is required a kind of 
relentless dedication (including the security) to acquiring 
the skills and resources that then concentrates these 
attributes into the moveset, the starting possible 
choices available to Agent A. For clarification, the 
likeness in these predecessor games to the Game of Chicken, 
with the aims of achieving the position of Agent A, rests
on the "security" in the relentless dedication. If Agents 
C and D are to compete, in forms direct or otherwise, to 
be Agent A instead of B in Game of Varying Coercion, then
they are to attempt to appear as doves in particular contexts.
Playing as the dove helps avoid direct confrontation with 
obstacles to their objective of becoming Agent A.

## Security's Price of Choice-Communication

There is a lot to be said,written, or however else 
communicated on the "power of language", specifically its 
broad role in retentive and transformative processes. 
There is a universal desire amongst sentient beings to 
privatize (form and uphold attributes of secrecy) 
communication to their personally desired degrees. 
Unwanted members, such as those that would oppose the 
communication or would be advantaged as antagonists to 
know said communication, are the subjects that privatization 
efforts seek to exclude. In this game, deemed the Game 
of Crypto or Gibberish, communication does not take 
place simply between two distinct beings. There are 
calculations and layers involved, manifesting themselves 
as functional judgments and tiered structures (geometric 
spaces,networks,et cetera). 

There are four agents in this game that consists of 
more than one cost table.
- Agent A: the interpreter of the communication.
- Agent B: the source and messenger of the communication.
- Agent C: correspondent to Agent A, otherwise known as a sub-agent of A; provides methodologies,tips, and hints derived from their observation of Agent B. Such observation may require insider knowledge.
- Agent D: the follow-up actor to the interpretation by Agent A of Agent B's communication.

Three primary decision junctions exist in the Game of 
Crypto or Gibberish, and this section sequentially presents 
explanation on them. 

Agent B has a question Q to provide an answer to. It 
knows that this answer, formatted according to some 
specification, will be received by Agent A. There are 
three possible choices for answers. 
- $I_1$: completely true in the case of Q being a fact-based query, otherwise completely genuine for Q that is a subjective-based query.
- $I_2$: trivial, sarcastic, ironic statement.
- $I_3$: completely fallacious or disingenious statement.

There are also three accomodating objective functions 
for Agent B, that ranks the choices for $I_j$ by ordinality. 
- $OBJ_1: I_1 > I_2 > I_3$,
- $OBJ_2: I_2 > I_1 > I_3$,
- $OBJ_3: I_3 > I_2 > I_1$.

The first junction is one decision by Agent B to format
its message into a secure format, such as digital encryption
via some arbitrary mask procedures, denoted by $M_k$. The 
"hardness" of the particular mask is denoted by $k$, such 
that $k$ is inversely proportional to this variable:
$1 > 2 > 3$. "Hardness", in computational complexity, 
refers to the expense of resources required to complete 
the calculation. So, $M_1$ is more complex than $M_2$ for 
a third-party to process. 

| $dec_j=1$ | $M_1$ | $M_2$ | $M_3$ |
| --------- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| $I_1$ | $OBJ_i(I_1)$,3 | $OBJ_i(I_1)$,2 | $OBJ_i(I_1)$,1 |
| $I_2$ | $OBJ_i(I_2)$,3 | $OBJ_i(I_2)$,2 | $OBJ_i(I_2)$,1 |
| $I_3$ | $OBJ_i(I_3)$,3 | $OBJ_i(I_3)$,2 | $OBJ_i(I_3)$,1 |

**GCG1:** Game of Crypto or Gibberish @ decision junction 1; (3 X 3).

For each cost-value pair $(c_0,c_1)$ in the table above, 
$c_0$ denotes the expense by objective $OBJ_i$ in sending 
information $I_j$ to Agent A, and $c_1$ denotes the price of 
using mask $M_k$. 

These two tables below are exemplifications of the objective
being $OBJ_1$ and $OBJ_2$, respectively.

| $dec_j=1$ | $M_1$ | $M_2$ | $M_3$ |
| --------- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| $I_1$ | 0,3 | 0,2 | 0,1 |
| $I_2$ | 1,3 | 1,2 | 1,1 |
| $I_3$ | 2,3 | 2,2 | 2,1 |

**GCGO1:** Table GCG1 by $OBJ_1$; (3 X 3).

| $dec_j=1$ | $M_1$ | $M_2$ | $M_3$ |
| --------- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| $I_1$ | 1,3 | 1,2 | 1,1 |
| $I_2$ | 0,3 | 0,2 | 0,1 |
| $I_3$ | 2,3 | 2,2 | 2,1 |

**GCG02:** Table GCG1 by $OBJ_2$; (3 X 3).

Lower expenses in objectives are preferred, for costs 
incurred upon the objective promote the failure of Agent B.
The direct association, between the value $c_1$ and the 
strength of the mask, is used by Agent B to decide on 
which mask to use. $M_1$ provides the greatest security
in transmission, that is, the lowest probability that 
a third-party (not Agent A or B) will able to possess 
full knowledge of. Junction 1 is a min-max decision 
problem. Mask $M_1$ is the dominated choice of mask, 
with respect to two-agent (A and B) privatization.
This decision problem could be further complicated 
by raising the question on the magnitude of privatization
desired by Agent B. Agent B could very well not care 
about maintaining "perfect secrecy", and choose one of 
the masks in $\{M_2,M_3\}$ so that some other arbitrary 
agent outside of $\{A,B,C,D\}$ can knowledgeably interfere.
