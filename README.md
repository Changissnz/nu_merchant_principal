# Nu Merchant Principal
## ~ ongoing notions by me, Richard Pham.

### The Big Principle: 
### In mercantilism, that "father figure" you had that told you "it is not about the money, it is about the principle" might just rape you dead and take all of your belongings...

Business comes and goes, much more frequently than governments. 
So how can commerce thrive without the dread of disillusionment
that stems from the lackluster payoff from zero-sum dynamics? 
Zero-sum dynamics carry an extremely bipolar nature in the 
psychology of actors. And there are few paradigms of thought 
outside of this zero-sum strategic convention in politics, 
business, and war. Well, to clarify, there are few paradigms 
of thought, outside of zero-sum, that have gained enough 
mainstream adoption for the concepts to be taught in typical 
higher education settings.

Brilliance does not quite make the mark in intensely competitive 
settings. But there are some that argue that it is the misuse 
of brilliance, trained and primed towards "malfeasant" outlets,
that results in clear defeats for the owner/s of that brilliance. 
But there have been and are plenty of brilliant people that 
did not quite train and prime themselves towards "malfeasant" 
outlets. And they get paid in dirt. The dumb and perhaps 
retarded scoff at their ideas, deny their promotion, and ruin 
their composure. This is how some brilliant people get treated
like dirt. They get invited to a club or party of some high-society
members, after achieving much and expecting some festive recognition, 
and the invites are rescinded. And the club/party mentions them as if 
they are some dull one fit for exploitation. The high-society 
members already know, due to the luxury and power that they 
are able to retain, that preventative measures against 
exploitation require more than just brilliance. Brilliance 
is materially less in value than dirt. The brilliant person 
wants to get somewhere, with rejection thrown in their face 
as well as insults and knives in their back, their so-called 
"defensive posturing" against exploitation is most definitely 
born from a source, or at least an effect, of malice. 

Do you really think that fat cow that is your neighbor really 
gives a care for your interests and well-being? Laissez-faire 
feudalism predicts that they do not. While you might be digging 
trenches for "modern-day Rome", that fat cow, the one that has 
never been hurt in any way except for their feelings, looks at
you like you are some kind of slave. The fat cow is stupid.
It is stupid not because it is simple-minded. It is stupid for 
judging while sitting comfortably in its welfare zone, sponsored 
by the government in the name of ... what? Merit? Justice? That
fat cow, ultimately in the context of economic sacrifice, may 
as well be a wolf. It may as well be a wolf because it would 
prefer that you are eaten instead of it.
