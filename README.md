Business comes and goes, much more frequently than governments. 
So how can commerce thrive without the dread of disillusionment
that stems from the lackluster payoff in zero-sum dynamics? 
Zero-sum dynamics carry an extremely bipolar nature in the 
psychology of actors. And there are few paradigms of thought 
outside of this zero-sum strategic convention in politics, 
business, and war. Well, to clarify, there are few paradigms 
of thought, outside of zero-sum, that have gained enough 
mainstream adoption for the concepts to be taught in typical 
higher education settings.

Brilliance does not quite make the mark in intensely competitive 
settings. But there are some that argue that it is the misuse 
of brilliance, trained and primed towards "malfeasant" outlets,
that results in clear defeats for the owner/s of that brilliance. 
But there have been and are plenty of brilliant people that 
did not quite train and prime themselves towards "malfeasant" 
outlets. And they get paid in dirt. The dumb and perhaps 
retarded scoff at their ideas, deny their promotion, and ruin 
their composure. This is how some brilliant people get treated
like dirt. They get invited to a club or party of some high-society
members, after achieving much and expecting some festive recognition, 
and the invites are rescinded. And the club/party mentions them as if 
they are some dull one fit for exploitation. The high-society 
members already know, due to the luxury and power that they 
are able to retain, that preventative measures against 
exploitation require more than just brilliance. Brilliance 
is materially less in value than dirt. The brilliant person 
wants to get somewhere, with rejection thrown in their face 
as well as insults and knives in their back, their so-called 
"defensive posturing" against exploitation is most definitely 
borne from a source, or at least an effect, of malice. 

Do you really think that fat cow that is your neighbor really 
gives a care for your interests and well-being? Laissez-faire 
feudalism predicts that they do not. While you might be digging 
trenches for "modern-day Rome", that fat cow, the one that has 
never been hurt in any way except for their feelings, looks at
you like you are some kind of slave. The fat cow is stupid.
It is stupid not because it is simple-minded. It is stupid for 
judging while sitting comfortably in its welfare zone, sponsored 
by the government in the name of ... what? Merit? Justice? That
fat cow, ultimately in the context of economic sacrifice, may 
as well be a wolf. It may as well be a wolf because it would 
prefer that you are eaten instead of it.

Suppose there is some kind of wisdom in ultra-competitive 
environments, borne out of Laissez-faire, that goes something 
similar as "one should make as much effort in befriending 
another as the effort required to defend against an enemy."
This is an "ideal" that is much easier to declare and believe in 
than to successfully accomplish. The difficulty of accomplishing
this "ideal" rests upon the nature that surrounds the center, 
for there is no mechanical principle behind it that ensures 
the equal probability of easiness in befriending and enemizing.
Who is to state, with a guarantee that rests completely on 
confidence instead of fear, that not every person becomes 
an enemy in the eyes of a "neo-mercantilist" (for lack of a 
better term)? 

The notion of the fat cow as a wolf in the context of 
economic sacrifice is a strong assumption on costs from 
loss due to some underlying fatalism. Rest assured that 
there are many in academia and government that strongly 
disagree with the concept of competition, or at least 
self-improvement, as zero-sum. These contrarian views 
harness the game theory specification of "non-zero sum 
games". The rationale is that some aspects, which can be
quantified, rest on a sort of cooperation, a mutual 
assurance, a compromise. There is much opinion and 
exemplification on non-zero sum games. These so-called 
"games" do exist in reality, but were only formalized 
into theoretical frameworks, for re-teaching, sometime 
in the last two centuries. By the standard of non-zero 
sum games, the fat cow does not have to be a wolf then! 

The mechanics of "costs", including but not limited to 
quantitative finance, are derived from the cultural 
mores and collective ambition, and also the mainstream 
economic concept of the correlation between scarcity 
and the magnitude of "cost", but the "faith" in these 
numbers does not rest on a uniform consensus of agreement. 
For instance, a sentimental person would probably prefer 
to sell something else other than the memorabilia 
that they've acquired through their years. There is 
the belief in the pricelessness of some material 
objects. Collectively, these same material objects 
could very well be circulated by the masses, according 
to some arbitrarily-set standard of valuation, if 
they are to land in their hands. There are psychological 
and collectivist elements in non-zero sum games. Suppose
that two agents are participants in such a game. Given 
the perceived costs in this game's cost table, the two 
agents "cooperate" for outcomes that grant them both 
"positive" gains, by the table's objective numbers. But
there is dissatisfaction underneath the compromise. 
Perhaps either one or both of the agents feel as though
they deserve more of the "positive" gains. What factors 
would ensure that for the next "game" these two agents 
participate in, there would be no disagreement on the
values of said game's cost table? On the matter of 
collectivist elements in non-zero sum games, suppose
that two arbitrary agents are enthusiastic participants. 
Both of them are practically in sync, with regards to 
their decisions and the corresponding payoffs from those
decisions. But regardless of what decisions they made,
there is a "super-agent" above them. This "super-agent"
is the singular representative of the collective outside
of the game's two agents. According to the facts given 
to this super-agent, both of the agents lose in the 
non-zero sum game. The deceptively "positive" gains split
between the two agents are in fact losses to them. Perhaps
the gains could have been objectively greater if the 
agents were to participate in non-zero sum games without
the overhead of the super-agent's authority. Perhaps
the gains are not objectively positive gains for the
two agents in the long term, given the super-agent's 
influence and capability of intervening between the 
two. 

Cultural, psychological, and collectivistic factors 
were especially noted in non-zero sum games, even
though their existence in zero-sum games is not 
negligible. It is obvious to state that zero-sum 
games, if based on accurate cost tables, result 
in "cleaner cuts". Every participant has very 
little motive to consider the outcome of well-being
for their "competitors". Zero-sum games rest on 
the principles of physics. Value cannot grow, but 
it can be cleanly transferred from some original 
owner, a participant in the zero-sum game, to 
another. The argument that zero-sum games are 
more objectively-based than non-zero sum games 
is more persuasive than the argument for vice-versa.

There is an absolute chance for arguments that non-zero
sum games are more amenable to participants. And the 
claim that the base of objectivity is an exclusive 
trait to zero-sum games is surely to be scrutinized. 
There is another claim that can be more fully 
agreed upon: for any prolonged sequence of 
decision-making events, the usage of both 
game categories serve unique demands. The payoffs 
to participants from non-zero sum games may amount 
to less for each, in comparison to the potential 
payoff (single participant gain) from zero-sum games.
But over time, the partial payoffs from each 
non-zero sum game produce longer lasting and more
stable benefits to the participants, by the metrics 
revolving around uniformity and the mean. Needless to 
say, these two categories of games can be expanded to
involve more than two agents in the lens of mass 
organization. Organizations do not tend to encourage
zero-sum games between its members, given the condition
that both members are of pertinence, through utility, to 
the organization (but perhaps not of the same degree). 
The compromise from non-zero sum games suits the purpose
of pacifying such biases, including jealousy and ambition, 
for integrity of the organization. However, in an 
organization's life, there occur instances where 
zero-sum games are utilized for the objective of 
slashing what is deemed to be excess or vice. 

The first paragraph of this essay posits the 
domineering influence of zero-sum, over others, such as 
the alternative of non-zero sum, as a concept taught
in the education setting. Many in university/government
settings would probably not be vocal in support of this
posit. Activities such as research&development, 
coordinated security, and journal publications do 
lean toward cost values of non-zero sum game. 
Knowledge, especially, is one of the fundamental 
possessions that does not operate on zero-sum dynamics 
on the one condition that the knowledge is fairly
distributed. One of the ideals espoused in higher 
education is something along the lines of "a more 
informed society is a superior society". But the 
value of knowledge wildly oscillates from trivia 
to critical vulnerabilities belonging to persons, 
organizations, nation-states, etc. What is a non-zero
sum game to a select group of participants may be
reflected onto another group as a zero-sum game's 
outcome that adversely affects them.

With regards to application of the concepts zero or
non-zero sum, the first is predominantly used in 
contexts such as material transfers and clear-cut
win/lose outcomes. Due to the cooperative nature 
of non-zero sum games, even with the specification 
that the participants do not know ahead of time 
what their counterparts' decisions are, there is 
a tendency for at least one of the participants 
to lose sight of the definition behind the outcome
values. The coupling (two participants) and 
entanglement (more than two participants) fuzz 
decision-making in such a way for there to be 
virtually no optimum payoff by the available 
options. Perhaps in some cases, contiguous 
non-zero sum games played by the participants 
may result for there to be a kind of "delegation"
from at least one of the players to the remainder.
The preferences of the remainder become prioritized
over the delegators, who would rather play and follow
along than to emphasize their own ideal choices 
in the "game". 

## Autonomy and Games <a name="p1"></a>

Autonomy is a multi-faceted question in arrangements 
that are games. Why would an agent participate in some 
arrangement called a game if there is the certainty 
that the best outcome, in the form of payoffs from 
the true cost table, cannot result in their betterment?
The agent diverges from their original circumstances
that would have granted them opportunities to pursue 
some desired sequence of outcomes, each a checkpoint of 
success or at least, gratification. Then they are 
enmeshed in circumstances that require their actions 
to be geared towards some objective directly related 
to the specific temporal demands of those circumstances.
They can mention the question of choice, a topic which 
is generally known to many members of societies that have 
had their hands forced into certain outlets (certainly by 
the mortal powers above them), but they will only receive
a response to accept the matter as another of idealism's
lost visions.

Children engage in activities that can be termed
as "games". These activities generally do no harm amongst
themselves, and give them the benefit of developing their
values and way of life to eventually play the roles of 
astute cogs in mature society. It is this premise that 
is a major moral justification for why some find themselves
in circumstances, deemed games by some, that they otherwise
would not engage in, either due to their ignorance that 
such circumstances (comprised of materials and events) exist 
or their involuntary stance towards those circumstances.
The premise as one word is education. Is this word 
simply a transmission of terminology and procedures,
as well as the auxiliary materials used to aid in 
understanding and experiencing this transmission of 
information? Could education really be as simple as two 
parallel straight paths, one the perfect transmission 
(by the educator) and the other the perfect practice or 
at least the most genuine effort in practice (by the educatee)? 

Entertain the notion that there are two tenets in education. 
For matters of fact, education transmits absolute truth. 
And for other matters, education transmits perfect knowledge 
of the methodology. This notion relies on the condition that
there is nothing to be educated on past the minds of the 
educators. The educators were selected due to their mastery 
of the matters that they are to transmit and train their 
educatees on. So the educators could not possibly steer
any of their subjects directly towards wrongful practices 
and fallacies. 

On the idea of autonomy as the choice to participate
in games that benefit and to not participate in anti-beneficial
games, education as outlined by the previous paragraph 
is beneficial. But in games that are believed not to be
beneficial, how can an agent truly know that they will 
sorely pay during or after their participation? Couple 
the particular outlining of education (in the previous 
paragraph) with active efforts to know the unknown (and 
all of the unknown's costs), from a perspective that supercedes
even the educator. And the resultant is not education by 
the definition. Instead, it is experimentation and education. 
Education systems can enable their educatees to experiment, 
outside of constraints designed by the educator.
There are certainly arguments available to defend these 
kinds of education systems, so that the educatees have 
greater awareness of what games will pay them off 
immensely, what other games are non-profit but greatly
expands the experience (if experience cannot be 
quantified), and yet still the remaining games that 
will make them sorely pay beyond their recovery back to 
growth or at least, stasis. 

The structuralization of any education system surely 
cannot accomodate the demands of the lifelong learner.
This is to assume that any education system imposes
binding demands on its participants. Without binding
demands, the freedom of participants to come and go 
by their own volition somehow dilutes the seriousness
and truthfulness of the informational material 
transmitted to them. In these circumstances, education
becomes casual recreation, and recreation is personally
experiential events; this is a Dionysian VS Apollonion 
argument. Even if one is not keen on learning any more 
past their depth, there is still the requirement 
of experience in sentient existence (if life goes on). 
And experience can be very stochastic, or even worse, 
engineered against those subject to the experience. The 
term "information-flow system" suffices as a superset 
of "education system". There are not required to be any 
binding demands from an educator that does not need to 
exist. The omnipresent requirement of processing 
information stands strong in this superset of an 
education system, even stronger than that of the 
education system since the lack of structured guidance 
is compensated by utter seriousness in certain contexts.

In many respects, the objective of education is to 
enhance and refine risk-averse mentalities and behaviors.
For example, mistakes from history should not be repeated.
Make careful calculations before embarking on dangerous
trails. Take the tragic lessons from literature to heart.
And so on. With experimentation, there is risk attached.
Experimentation is interesting with regards to 
accountability. Educators generally steer clear from 
the losses from experimentation. The simple more is that
they cannot risk their reputation to become entangled 
in what are perceived by third-party judges as fallibility 
traps. The fact that there are different natures and 
styles attached to those that experiment validates the 
anticipation that conceptualizations of fallibility, such 
as the Seven Deadly Sins, are to be mentioned by some in 
their aims to "reveal and penalize evil". 

Autonomy is intricately connected to information-flow
systems. Some important attributes of noteworthy mention
are filtration processes, recognition mechanisms, flow 
control, network administration, and ultimately, capabilities 
past the knowledge that is perfect information.

## Situational Engineering <a name="p2"></a>

The academic field of game theory has mass-proliferated
some important findings in the context of decision-making.
It has structured "games", decision-making junctions between 
two or more agents, into these classifications: strategic, 
extensive, and coalitional. It has also put focus on the 
nature of information available to agents during their 
activities called "games", that is, perfect and imperfect 
information. Rules for calculating the optimal decision
are defined by the Nash equilibrium and its sibling 
concepts. In cases where there is no optimum by the decisions
and costs granted to the agents, there is also the 
"ideal" (or expectation) of steady state, as illustrated
by games such as Matching Pennies. 

The mathematics applied in game theory is extensive enough 
to satisfy these two big questions: 
- best decisions or expected states,
- expected payoffs (through probabilistic functions or 
best-decision rules). 

But what about the situation? Given merely the cost tables 
(as formulated by game theory), some agents are predisposed
to having some set of moves that may or may not intersect
with the movesets of their co-participants. In other words,
there is an unspoken asymmetry or equality in capabilities
before the consideration of the game in focus. Acceptance of
these conditions relies on the acceptance of the histories
(for lack of a better term) of not only the agents belonging
to the game in focus. There is also the need to understand 
the outside factors, some of which may be responsible for 
governing past events, agents, interpretations, and orders 
into the situation that contains the participating agents. 

Consider this situation, called Game of Varying Coercion. 
There are only two players to make way for simplicity of 
illustration.

| t=1 | Play Along | Reveal |
| --- | ---------- | ------ |
| Silent Trigger | 10,1 | 10,-100 |
| Brute's Force | -1,0 | 5,-50 |

**GVC1:** Game of Varying Coercion @ timestamp 1; (2 x 2).

Agent A (row-wise) has the clear upper hand, in terms of
cost as quantified by this table. Agent B is put into a
servile position. Agent A would be wise to maintain 
preference for the dominated action of Silent Trigger.
There is no possibility for Silent Trigger to inflict 
negative gains for Agent A. Whether Agent B chooses to
obey Agent A by playing along, or revealing so as to 
catalyze revolt against Agent A, Agent A secures its 
upper hand by Silent Trigger. For Agent A to act by 
Brute's Force against an obedient Agent B speaks poorly 
for its welfare, as denoted by the negative gain of 
-1. If Brute's Force is used against Agent B in the 
case of its act of revealing, then there is a positive 
gain of half that for Silent Trigger. Suppose the 
revelation is judged to be fallacious, so much that 
Brute's Force is justified.  

Silent Trigger requires more skill by the actor. It
also requires more situational expenses so that the
silence of the Trigger is not exposed to Agent B or
third-party observers, who then have more knowledge 
and material to retaliate. The cost values of Table GVC1
denote the combative gains by the agents. However, 
there is another set of costs that are pertinent, 
by Table ST1. 

| ~~ | Effective Cooperative | Ineffective Cooperative |
| --- | ---------- | ------ |
| Bull's Eye | -3,-12 | -1000,-50 |
| Missed Mark | -30,-100 | -1200,-1000 |

**ST1:** Costs to Resources by Silent Trigger; (2 x 2).

There are two possibilities for the actor behind Silent 
Trigger, labeled by the rows. The infrastructural costs, 
comprised of sentient agents, the environment, and the 
situation that is staged by these sentient agents, are 
the two columns: effective and ineffective cooperative. 
The cooperative is designated as an alignment with the 
Silent Trigger's actor. Note that there are no positive
gains to resources. If the cooperative is ineffective, 
whether voluntarily or not, then it is critical for 
Silent Trigger's actor to move by Bull's Eye, in the 
name of costs to resources. If there is effective 
cooperative, the event of Missed Mark by Silent Trigger's 
actor results in less damage to resources. Table ST1 
illustrates the heavy costs, even without the risk of 
failure by Silent Trigger's actor and their cooperative, 
of maintaining the dominated action of Silent Trigger 
over Brute's Force. 

By Brute's Force, however, there is a risk that 
oppositional mass-organization from Agent B 
(in Table GVC1) ensues. The situation of the involved 
agents can escalate into something similar to that 
illustrated below.

| ~~ | Advance Opposition | Maintain Opposition | Withdraw Opposition |
| --- | -------------------- | ------------------- | ----------------- | 
| Escalate Brute's Force | 1000,500 | 250,250 | 2000,0 | 
| Mix Brute's Force with Silent Trigger | 2000,-50 | 1000,500 | 2000,-300
| Silent Trigger | 0,400 | 0,0 | 4000,-200

**BFAM:** Combative Gains (Opponent's Pay) in the Aftermath of Initial Brute's Force; (3 x 3).

Table BFAM gives numbers that still predominantly benefit Agent A.
But these numbers are based only the starting states of the agents, 
and shed no evidence on the constancy of costs over repeated iterations.
Brute's Force may result in the situation of Table BFAM, and the decision 
for Agent A to choose Brute's Force over Silent Trigger may be due to 
the latter's unsuccessful enactment, which in turn, is due to the 
negative gains. Silent Trigger in BFAM, due to its requirements of 
high skill and effective cooperative, becomes virtually useless 
unless Agent B chooses to withdraw opposition. 

The Game of Varying Coercion is an antagonistic game. It 
requires for there to be an aggressive antagonist and an 
incapable subordinate target, with much less the social and 
communicative resources than available to its opposer. What 
kind of game is this, for there to be irrationality on the 
part of Agent B that results in its entering this situation? 
Game theoretics do presuppose that agents act by rational 
choice, before, during, and after any arbitrary decision 
junction that is a game. As stated in the beginning of this 
section, the rationale for why situations such as Game of 
Varying Coercion occur is essentially long, nuanced, 
specific explanations based on histories. A more civilized 
version of this game can certainly exist, as Game of 
Pacified Varying Coercion. 

| t=1 | Genuinely Cooperate | Civil Re-negotiation | Fraud/Betrayal |
| --- | ------------------- | -------------------- | -------------- |
| Pacified Silent Trigger | 100,100 | 0,0 | 1000,0 |
| Pacified Brute's Force | -1000,0 | -100,500 | 1000,0 |

**GPVC1:** Game of Pacified Varying Coercion @ timestamp 1; (2 X 3).

There is the question of the degree of choice 
revolving around the hands (of the agents and third-parties) 
in the Game of Varying Coercion. Would it not be splendid if
there was only the alternative of Game of Pacified Varying 
Coercion to be played? There would be little motive for any 
rational Agent B to choose Fraud/Betrayal. The integrity of 
the feedback loops involving genuine cooperation and civil 
re-negotiations would lead to a continuous improvement 
process, without any second thoughts. But back to the matter 
of the Game of Varying Coercion, it could be argued that 
the events leading up to the asymmetric attributes of the 
involved players are essentially sibling decision junctions 
of the Game of Chicken. The key difference is that in the 
Game of Chicken, the objective is mirror-opposite decisions. 
To achieve the moveset of Agent A in Game of Varying Coercion,
as a game before this game, there is required a kind of 
relentless dedication (including the security) to acquiring 
the skills and resources that then concentrates these 
attributes into the moveset, the starting possible 
choices available to Agent A. For clarification, the 
likeness in these predecessor games to the Game of Chicken, 
with the aims of achieving the position of Agent A, rests
on the "security" in the relentless dedication. If Agents 
C and D are to compete, in forms direct or otherwise, to 
be Agent A instead of B in Game of Varying Coercion, then
they are to attempt to appear as doves in particular contexts.
Playing as the dove helps avoid direct confrontation with 
obstacles to their objective of becoming Agent A.

## Security's Price of Choice-Communication <a name="p3"></a>

There is a lot to be said,written, or however else 
communicated on the "power of language", specifically its 
broad role in retentive and transformative processes. 
A universal desire exists amongst sentient beings to 
privatize (form and uphold attributes of secrecy) 
communication to their personally desired degrees. 
Unwanted members, such as those that would oppose the 
communication or would be advantaged as antagonists to 
know said communication, are the subjects that privatization 
efforts seek to exclude. In this game, deemed the Game 
of Crypto or Gibberish, communication does not take 
place simply between two distinct beings. There are 
calculations and layers involved, manifesting themselves 
as functional judgments and tiered structures (geometric 
spaces,networks,et cetera). 

There are four agents in this game that consists of 
more than one cost table.
- Agent A: the interpreter of the communication.
- Agent B: the source and messenger of the communication.
- Agent C: correspondent to Agent A, otherwise known as a sub-agent of A; they provide methodologies,tips, and hints derived from their observation of Agent B. Such observation may require positioning for insider knowledge.
- Agent D: the follow-up actor to the interpretation by Agent A of Agent B's communication.

Whenever Agent A is mentioned, assume that Agent C is 
also included due to their status as a sub-agent to Agent A.

Three primary decision junctions exist in the Game of 
Crypto or Gibberish, and this section sequentially presents 
explanation on them. 

Agent B has a question Q to provide an answer to. They 
know that this answer, formatted according to some 
specification, will be received by Agent A. There are 
three possible choices for answers. 
- $I_1$: completely true in the case of Q being a fact-based query, otherwise completely genuine for Q that is a subjective-based query.
- $I_2$: trivial, sarcastic, ironic statement.
- $I_3$: completely fallacious or disingenious statement.

There are also three accomodating objective functions 
for Agent B that ranks the choices for $I_j$ by ordinality. 
- $OBJ_1: I_1 > I_2 > I_3$,
- $OBJ_2: I_2 > I_1 > I_3$,
- $OBJ_3: I_3 > I_2 > I_1$.

The first junction is one decision by Agent B to format
their message into a secure format, such as digital encryption
via some arbitrary mask procedures, denoted by $M_k$. The 
"hardness" of the particular mask is denoted by $k$, such 
that $k$ is inversely proportional to this variable:
$1 > 2 > 3$. "Hardness", in computational complexity, 
refers to the expense of resources required to accurately 
complete the calculation. So, $M_1$ is more complex than 
$M_2$ for a third-party to process. 

| $dec_t=1$ | $M_1$ | $M_2$ | $M_3$ |
| --------- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| $I_1$ | $OBJ_i(I_1)$,3 | $OBJ_i(I_1)$,2 | $OBJ_i(I_1)$,1 |
| $I_2$ | $OBJ_i(I_2)$,3 | $OBJ_i(I_2)$,2 | $OBJ_i(I_2)$,1 |
| $I_3$ | $OBJ_i(I_3)$,3 | $OBJ_i(I_3)$,2 | $OBJ_i(I_3)$,1 |

**GCG1:** Game of Crypto or Gibberish @ decision junction 1; (3 X 3).

For each cost-value pair $(c_0,c_1)$ in the table above, 
$c_0$ denotes the expense on objective $OBJ_i$ in sending 
information $I_j$ to Agent A, and $c_1$ denotes the price of 
using mask $M_k$. 

These two tables below are exemplifications of the objective
being $OBJ_1$ and $OBJ_2$, respectively.

| $dec_t=1$ | $M_1$ | $M_2$ | $M_3$ |
| --------- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| $I_1$ | 0,3 | 0,2 | 0,1 |
| $I_2$ | 1,3 | 1,2 | 1,1 |
| $I_3$ | 2,3 | 2,2 | 2,1 |

**GCGO1:** Table GCG1 by $OBJ_1$; (3 X 3).

| $dec_t=1$ | $M_1$ | $M_2$ | $M_3$ |
| --------- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| $I_1$ | 1,3 | 1,2 | 1,1 |
| $I_2$ | 0,3 | 0,2 | 0,1 |
| $I_3$ | 2,3 | 2,2 | 2,1 |

**GCG02:** Table GCG1 by $OBJ_2$; (3 X 3).

Lower expenses in objectives are preferred, for costs 
incurred upon the objective promote the failure of Agent B.
The direct association, between the value $c_1$ and the 
strength of the mask, is used by Agent B to decide on 
which mask to use. $M_1$ provides the greatest security
in transmission, that is, the lowest probability that 
a third-party (those that Agent A has not shared with) 
will able to possess full knowledge of. Junction 1 is a 
min-max decision problem. The information $I_j$ with the 
lowest corresponding $c_0$ score is the dominated choice. 
Mask $M_1$ is the dominated choice of mask, with respect 
to two-agent (A and B) privatization. This decision problem 
could be further complicated by raising the question on 
the magnitude of privatization desired by Agent B. Agent 
B could very well not care about maintaining "perfect 
secrecy", and chooses one of the masks in $\{M_2,M_3\}$ 
so that some other arbitrary agent outside of $\{A,B,C,D\}$ 
can knowledgeably interfere.

Now onto the second decision junction, with specific focus 
on Agents A and C. Correspondent Agent C's responsibility 
was to "observe" Agent B for information regarding the 
important attribute of the mask $M_k$ used as well as their
objective with respect to $I_j$. While gathering information 
on the mask is an empirical task, meaning the knowledge 
gathered on its form and parameters can be judged on a 
continuum spanning from absolutely false to absolutely 
true (but the question remains on when the judgment 
can take place), prediction of Agent B's objective 
is not as clearly defined, in great part because Agent B 
could very well change their objective a split instance 
before for a future decision unanticipated by Agents A 
or C. Prediction of Agent B's objective is clearly 
a probabilistic problem, with some reasonable solution 
catered to their behavioral leanings. Below is a possible
cost table that accomodates the second decision junction.

| $dec_t=2$ | $D_1$ | $D_2$ | $D_3$ | $D_{null}$ |
| --------- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ---------- |
| $M_?(I_j)$ | 1,3 | 1,2 | 1,1 | 1,0 | 

**GCGT2:** Decision junction 2 for Agent A with C; (1 X 4).

The table GCGT2 pre-supposes that Agent A has been 
able to ascertain the three available masks, as presented
in table GCG1. If Agent B wants Agent A to have the 
capability to decrypt the message $M_?(I_j)$, then they 
encourage conditions that grant Agent A (through themself 
or their correspondent Agent C) the knowledge of either 
the actual (inarguable) mask $M_?$ or some combination
of the masks $\{M_1,M_2,M_3\}$. The numbers in this 
cost table mean very little, in terms of deciding on the 
best out of the four choices, because the aims of Agent
A is to derive one of $\{I_1,I_2,I_3\}$ from $M_?(I_j)$.
Agent A, for their serious intents and purposes, would 
only be interested in $I_1$, possibly $I_2$ if $I_2$ 
sheds some inkling (decreases the breadth of possibilities) 
on $I_1$. If $I_j$ in table GCGT2 is one of $\{I_2,I_3\}$,
then Agent A could use a null decryptor $D_{null}$ that
produces no legible information. Assume that in this 
game, having full knowledge of a mask $M_i$ naturally 
lends way to determining the corresponding de-masker 
$D_i$. If Agent B simply wants for Agent A to receive 
$M_?(I_j)$ without providing them any direct or indirect 
knowledge on the mask used, then Agent C would have to 
put precise and greater effort in ascertaining $M_?$. 
Agent A would not know that $I_1$ is the best option 
if decision junction 1 is carefully implemented by 
Agent B in a way that uniformly splits believability 
between the members of $\{I_1,I_2,I_3\}$, as the 
answer to question Q. Then Agent A, upon their belief 
that $M_?(I_j)$ is pertinent, advances ahead to 
attempting to use the correct de-masker for the 
result $I_j$.

On the matter of capabilities, if masks $M_1,M_2$ 
and $M_3$ are somehow connected in their calculative 
procedures, then Agent A's ascertainment of $M_1$ 
naturally lends way to them also having the capability 
to ascertain $M_2$ and $M_3$.

Cost table GCGT2 could be further complicated 
if Agent B were to, instead of selecting only 
one $I_j$ by their objective $OBJ_i$, instead sends 
some combinational set of size greater than 1 from 
$\{I_1,I_2,I_3\}$ to Agent A. 

| $dec_t=2$ | $D_1$ | $D_2$ | $D_3$ | $D_{null}$ |
| --------- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ---------- |
| $M_?(I_1)$ | 1,3 | 1,2 | 1,1 | 1,0 | 
| $M_?(I_2)$ | 1,3 | 1,2 | 1,1 | 1,0 | 
| $M_?(I_3)$ | 1,3 | 1,2 | 1,1 | 1,0 | 

**GCGT22:** Decision junction 2 for Agent A with C in the event of plural information $I_j$; (3 X 4).

The extent of labor required of Agent C, as well 
as the degree of their skills in information acquisition,
in determining the credibility of $I_j$ is proportional 
to the design, objective, and performance of Agent
B's transmission.

Moving onto decision junction 3, it is now Agent D's
turn to act. Agent D is given the information 
$W=D_?(M_?(I_j))$. They must decide on how to act on 
$W$. They could just rest their decision on the judgments 
from correspondent Agent C of A, and move on ahead
to acting by their prescribed procedure.

| $dec_t=3$ | $A_{pro}$ | $A_{contra}$ | $A_{null}$ |
| --------- | --------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| $W$ | ?,? | ?,? | ?,? |

**GCGT3:** Decision junction 3 for Agent D, the follow-up actor 
to the plain information received from Agent A; (1 X 3). $A_{?}$
is a possible classification of action to take. 

The Game of Crypto or Gibberish has a few noteworthy
attributes that if, left unmentioned explicitly, 
may lead to alternative understanding. Every junction 
point is a decision to be taken by exactly one agent. 
Each decision may be comprised of more than one choice, 
a choice as an $(n,m)$'th element in the appropriate 
cost table. Given the abstract of this game, there 
cannot exist a deterministic function that predicts 
what decisions are to be taken at every one of these 
junction points. With accurate experimental data 
taken pertaining to some group of agents that 
collectively play the roles of Agents A through D, 
probabilistic methodologies can yield decision 
functions with predictive accuracy on the outcome 
of the game greater than that offered on the basis 
of "random" chance. In the Game of Crypto or 
Gibberish, the three cost tables, each one for one 
decision junction, can be amalgamated into a 
single cost table. This single cost table is 
an action-oriented cost table. The outcome of 
the action that D is to take is the primary 
consideration in cost assignment, as a direct 
determinant for decision.

Relations between Agents A through D are an 
important aspect in this reduction to a single 
cost table, that can in turn be represented 
in at least two ways.

In the first route, there are three relations, 
each with their own particular set of variables 
and operators.
- $\mathrel{R}(A,B)$: Connected to the $OBJ_i$ selected by B in its message,
  the particular message communicated by B, and the decision by $A$ at decision junction 2.
- $\mathrel{R}(A,D)$: Connected to the preference of A to want for D to 
  - follow its preference on what action D should take,
  - allow for D to take the most ideal action based on A's transmitted interpretation of B's
    message.  
- $\mathrel{R}(B,D)$: Connected to the $OBJ_i$ selected by B, the action that B desires for 
  D to take, and the action that best suits the interests of D. 

The function $\mathrel{F}(A,B,D)$ is formulated as
$\mathrel{F}(A,B,D)= \mathrel{R}(A,B) \times_0 \mathrel{R}(A,D) \times_1 \mathrel{R}(B,D) \times_2 \epsilon.$ The symbol $\times_?$ is an arbitrary 
commutative operator, and any two $\times_i,\times_j$ do not have 
to equal each other. The error term $\epsilon$ allows for 
a precise fit. 

Function $\mathrel{F}(A,B,D)$ is used to determine the specific 
two-value cost for each action $A_{pos},A_{contra},A_{null}$ 
that Agent D can take:
$\mathrel{F}(A,B,D)(A_{?}) \rightarrow (c_0,c_1).$
The values $c_0$ and $c_1$ have opposite signage to one another. 

The single cost table, by this first route of expression, is 

| ~~~~~~~~~ | $A_{pro}$ | $A_{contra}$ | $A_{null}$ |
| --------- | --------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| $\{A,B,D\}$ | $\mathrel{F}(A,B,D)(A_{pro})$ | $\mathrel{F}(A,B,D)(A_{contra})$ | $\mathrel{F}(A,B,D)(A_{null})$ |

**GCGSINGLE:** Single-table expression (route one) of the outcomes possible to the involved agents in Game of Crypto or Gibberish; (1 x 3).

And the best action to take, when the cost values $(c_0,c_1)$
are oriented for the relation of greater as better, is
the one with the maximum value $c_0+c_1$ from function 
$\mathrel{F}(A,B,D)$. 

For the second route, every agent A,B,D has a corresponding 
valuation function $V_{?}$ that produces a cost-value pair $(c_0,c_1)$ 
on the outcome from the action taken by D (after its receipt of A's 
interpretation of B's message).

| ~ | $A_{pro}$ | $A_{contra}$ | $A_{null}$ |
| - | --------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| A | $V_{A}(A_{pro})$  | $V_{A}(A_{contra})$ | $V_{A}(A_{null})$ |
| B | $V_{B}(A_{pro})$ | $V_{B}(A_{contra})$ | $V_{B}(A_{null})$ |
| D | $V_{D}(A_{pro})$ | $V_{D}(A_{contra})$ | $V_{D}(A_{null})$ | 

**GCGSINGLE2:** Single-table expression (route two) of the outcomes possible to the involved agents in Game of Crypto or Gibberish; (1 x 3).

The problem that cost table GCGSINGLE2 asks to solve 
is to determine the action $A_{?}$ that Agent D would 
take to yield the "most benefit" to itself and 
Agents A,B. There are two standard mathematical 
approaches. 
- Select $A_{?}$ based on the greatest cumulative summation 
  $c_0+c_1$ from valuation functions $V_{A}$ through 
  $V_{D}$. 
- Select $A_{?}$ based on the least variance of 
  $c_0+c_1$ between valuation functions $V_{A}$ through 
  $V_{D}$.

In the first approach, there is the belief that the
action with the greatest singular value produced from 
the cumulative attributes and decisions of Agents A 
through D is most beneficial. In the second approach, 
there is the belief that the action with the most even 
distribution of gains or losses between Agents A through 
D is superior.

The Game of Crypto or Gibberish has the distinction of 
possessing an innate and constant opaque nature to guard
against convenient understanding. Exemplifications of the 
Game of Crypto or Gibberish can be revealed towards full 
understanding, but perhaps the revelation takes place 
only after the actualization of events during timespans 
displeasing for the impatient or those that cannot afford 
the time. 

## Maintenance as Half-Measures of the Potential <a name="p4"></a>

Maintenance is associated with aspiring towards the
"constant", the "equilibrium", and confusingly, some 
quality/ies of the full picture belonging to a context 
that is a zero-sum dynamic. If maintenance was the 
absolute peak of potential for an entity, then there 
can be no question on what further magnitudes they can 
accomplish, relegated to the confines of their peak 
potential action of maintenance. Destruction consists
of related but not entirely connected phenomena to 
maintenance. A casual reminder on destruction is it 
is enabled by specific conditions stemming from 
over-maintenance (excess magnitude in pro-activity) and 
lack of maintenance (negligible activity). Destruction is 
not the focus of this section, although phenomena 
labeled as destructive has a contradicting relationship
with the defined ideals of maintenance.   

A construct called the Game of Tree-Trimming is used 
to aid in quantitatively abstracting maintenance. The 
Game of Tree-Trimming is one, similar to the previously 
discussed Game of Crypto or Gibberish, with multiple 
cost tables in consideration. Threshold-activation, a 
quantitative condition that places demands on an actor 
with respect to their achieving some objective for them 
to move onto a different cycle or step, is an important 
component of the Game of Tree-Trimming and accounts for
the continuum belonging to the actor's potential. 

Similar to the Game of Crypto or Gibberish, the Game of
Tree-Trimming has four primary agents. 
- Agent T: the tree, comprised of a trunk (including the root) as 
  $R$ and the connected branches $B$. Every branch $B$ 
  has some arbitrary quantity of leaves $L$ and fruit $U$. 
  While a branch $B$ connects to T's periphery of $L$ and 
  $U$, it is still a strict subset of $R$, meaning that it 
  can never be $R$. T has exactly one process, to naturally 
  grow, that is, proliferate itself to be of a greater mass 
  through extension of any one of its component classifications, 
  the root $R$, branches $B$, leaves $L$, and fruit $U$. 
  Outside of T's natural growth process, they do not have any 
  mechanism of free-will to act in any other way. 
- Agent A: in charge of modifying T via its only action
  of cutting. The magnitude of cutting power available to Agent
  A is left undefined by default.
- Agent B: by its ordainment of continually perfect information 
  on Agent T, commands to Agent A its preference on how 
  Agent A should cut. 
- Agent C: otherwise known as a third-party or unknown factor. Plays
  some role of advisor or ruler on Agent A's judgment of the appropriate
  command to Agent B. 

One important constraint is placed on the capabilities of Agents 
B,A, and C with regards to treatment of Agent T. The growth 
process of Agent T cannot be augmented by any Agents B,A, or C
outside of A's cutting actions. The Game of Tree-Trimming is 
an abstraction, and so does not include real-life considerations 
such as environmental engineering that would affect Agent T's 
growth process. Maintenance as half-measures of the potential
refers to A's cutting actions, and the maximum cutting power
(potential) of A is measured by its capability to cut the 
leaves $L$ and fruit $U$, branches $B$, and the root $R$ of 
Agent T. There is a non-zero observable probability for any 
branch $B$ to be a finitely recursive structure. A branch $B$ 
may contain some arbitrary number of sub-branches, each still
classified as a branch.

A hierarchical demand-flow is what the Game of Tree-Trimming 
relies on. Agent T's one action of its growth process is 
ascribed to the realm of "natural activity". The unidirectional 
source of influence for Agent A's cutting actions is from Agent 
B's convolutional decision-making process, that which involves 
contributions from Agent C. 

![image info](./images/gtt_flow_diagram.PNG)

**GTTD:** Flow-diagram for Game of Tree-Trimming. 

Categories of threshold-activated functions, pertaining to 
Agent A's actions, exist to fit the attributes of Agent T. 
One category is for fruit and leaves, another for the 
branches, and the last for the root $R$.

| branch | geometric measure |
| --------- | ----- |
| $B_0$ | $m_0$ | 
| $B_1$ | $m_1$ |
| $B_2$ | $m_2$ |
| ... | ... |

**TBR:** Two-column table of branches and their corresponding non-negative geometric measures.

The threshold function for trimming branches is 
$F_{branch}$, which outputs a (minimum,maximum)
activation range, and is controlled by the 
convolutional judgment of Agents B with C. 

In terms of efficiency and uniformity, it would 
make sense for $F_{branch}$ to produce activation
ranges roughly equal to each other for each branch.
However, in terms of aesthetics, each branch surely
has a probability of being assigned an activation 
range from $F_{branch}$ distinct from that of at least 
one other branch. Recall that since a branch may 
be finitely recursive, so that some branch $B_x$ 
may be a subset of another branch $B_y$ in table TBR,
then the most efficient cutting procedure for 
Agent A to take based on $F_{branch}$ from Agent 
B is to first determine which of the branches fit
their respective ranges for cutting. For any connected
set of branches,
$B_{x_1} \subset B_{x_2} \subset \dots \subset B_{x_n}$, 
select the biggest branch $B_{x_j}$ that is judged by Agent B
to need cutting, and cut it. This approach guarantees 
the fewest number of cuts required. But there is one 
issue not yet mentioned, and that is the <ins>regenerative
potential</ins> of Agent T after these cuts are made. Suppose
for each branch $B_x$ that fits the activation range
to be cut, the cut by Agent A applied to its specific 
geometry results in an end so dead that no regenerative 
process from T can grow back $B_x$ to its former geometry
and beyond.

The threshold-activation function $F_{L,U}$ is similar
to $F_{branch}$. But since branches are recursive structures,
the methodology for selecting the fruits and leaves is 
more straightforward. And $F_{L,U}$ produces more uniform 
threshold-activation ranges than $F_{branch}$, on the 
natural basis that all fruits and leaves from Agent T 
are of a uniform nature respective to their categories.
Cutting just the fruit and leaves of Agent T bears no 
possibility for future dead ends. The fruit and leaves
regenerate based on the volition of Agent T's root $R$.

And the last threshold-activation function $F_{root}$ 
is quite complicated to generalize. For Agent A to 
cut the root $R$ of Agent T, if it really can, Agent 
B would have to deem the act vital to its interests.
Perhaps Agent B, through its convolutional thought 
processes with Agent C, thinks that Agent T has 
"outserved its purpose" to it. Its judgment may be 
derived from the temporal accounting of poor yield
belonging to Agent T, through the branches, fruits, 
and leaves cut. Perhaps Agent B has determined that 
there is a better alternative to Agent T, such as 
another replacement tree or no tree whatsoever.
The function $F_{root}$ outputs a value of 1 (cut 
it) or 0 (do not cut it). $F_{root}$ is to answer 
the question of preferring source elimination
over source control. 

These three threshold-activation functions suffer 
from the probable problem of <ins>piecewise contradiction</ins>
between their outputs. For Agent B to judge, based on 
its function $F_{L,U}$ to not cut a particular 
leaf or fruit $f$, but for its function $F_{branch}$
to label a branch $B$, holding $f$, to be cut 
is an example of this contradiction. Similar 
forms of contradiction exist with relations 
involving $F_{root}$.

As mentioned in the initial introduction of the 
four agents in the Game of Tree-Trimming, Agent
A's cutting power is undefined by default, but 
a sane presupposition can be made that this 
power it has is finite and non-static. An 
opportune time for Agent A to cut some part of 
Agent T may not come again.

## Wasting the Drive in Gridlock <a name="p5"></a>

Gridlock describes a condition with particular
traits in a group of entities (two or more), 
with at least one entity thinking and acting for an 
interest that does not align with at least one co-entity 
in this group. The perception of gridlock has a level
of difficulty in detection, whether by members of 
the involved group or a third-party, proportional
to the cumulative difficulty in accurately measuring 
each member's advances (improvements, actualization, 
et cetera) in their interest over a selected period 
in time. In gridlock, membership of an entity in a 
group does not require their voluntary consent. 
Enactment of connective principles such as contractual 
agreements, socio-economic magnetism, and co-dependencies 
are some of the preventative measures against an entity's
attempt to separate themselves, by their own perogative
from a group. 

Suppose a group D has five entities in it:
$D= \{E_0,E_1,E_2,E_3,E_4\}.$

**NOTE**
The integer five is a common number, alongside two and 
three, in the context of division or at least difference. 
Five is the value from halving in base-10 numerical 
systems. It was chosen as the number of entities in 
this example based on this premise. 

Each of the entities $E_i$ is associated with an 
interest $I_i$. In group D, there exists at least one
pair of entities $(E_i,E_j)$ with relations, based on 
their interests, that do not align. In formulaic notation,
that is 
$R_{align}(I_i,I_j) = false.$
The objective of each entity's interest is to yield some
outcome: $OBJ(I_i) \rightarrow O_i$. 
The outcome, for practical intents and purposes, is typically
a set of variable values. Each variable value of an outcome $O_i$
falls on a continuum or a discrete space $S_i$, such as boolean, of 
their respective attribute. Additionally, every variable value
is supposed to satisfy only a portion $P_i$ of the space of 
possibilities. In other words, the satisfying condition for 
objective $OBJ(I_i)$, based on the associated possible outcomes, 
is $P_i \subseteq S_i$. Based on the nullifying initiator, 
the lack of alignment $R_{align}(I_i,I_j)$, the outcomes for 
the entities of D are the following. 

| Interest | Wanted Outcome | Actual Outcome |
| -------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| $I_0$ | $P_0$ | $P^{?}_0$ |
| $I_1$ | $P_1$ | $P^{?}_1$ |
| $I_2$ | $P_2$ | $P^{?}_2$ |
| $I_3$ | $P_3$ | $P^{?}_3$ |
| $I_4$ | $P_4$ | $P^{?}_4$ |

**GRLK:** Table showing the wanted and actual outcomes for 
each entity of group D. None of the actual outcomes in the 
table above equal their corresponding wanted outcome, due 
to gridlock.

To conclude on this section's generalization of gridlock, 
gridlock places demands on each entity in the group 
in such a way that no entity's state can improve via 
efforts for their interest. The lack of alignment, which 
could also include malignment, between the interests of 
at least two entities fuels a nullification process 
that breaks the wanted outcomes of all involved entities 
in the gridlocked group. The Game of Breaking Gridlock 
helps to illustrate some of the activity, efforts by 
members to break free  of the gridlock and perhaps even 
separate from the group, that may occur in gridlocked 
groups. 

In this game, a group G of entities are in a gridlock, 
a condition that has been generally defined in the 
beginning of this section. In this gridlock arrangement, 
none of the entities can "outperform" any other 
co-entity. The term "outperform" is a strict classifying 
term on an entity's success in achieving its interests, 
by <ins>relying on its own autonomy of resources and 
capabilities</ins> at the initializing instance of the Game 
of Breaking Gridlock (gridlock has already been set). 
Entities can attempt to "outperform" another by increasing 
the magnitude of their resources' and/or capabilities' 
utility, but gridlock will prevent their outperforming 
by this game's starting state. There can be intersection 
(sharing) of control (autonomy) between members of a 
group with respect to resources or capabilities, 
at the expense of administrative simplicity. The objective 
of at least one of the entities in a gridlock is 
"subversion" of the gridlock arrangement. Generally, 
"subversion" can be achieved by an entity outperforming 
or, antithetically, undermining another to such an extent 
that the other's performance falls short by some 
measures that would have ensured the preservation of 
the gridlock arrangement. The full achievement of subversion 
disintegrates the conservative force behind gridlock, 
thereby enabling at least one of the entities in the group 
to achieve their original interest. 

The below diagram illustrates the connective arrangement 
in a gridlock of the five entities of group D, from this 
section's beginning. Each two-headed arrow is a relation 
between two entities. The lack of labeling and functions 
for each of these two-headed arrows is intentional, leaving
the nature, biases, and leanings of each relation open 
to the specificities involved in practical affairs.

![image info](./images/gbg_diagram1.PNG)

**GBGD1:** Graphical illustration of group D's connectivity. In mathematical lexicon, this 
group is a complete graph. There is no correlation between node positioning and entity 
rank in the group. 

If the five entities of D exist in a closed world, and they 
conserve their activity for their constant interests, then
gridlock is expected to last for an indeterminate amount of
time. In cases in which D does not exist in a closed world
(perhaps a world is better understood as constructed and 
defined rather than the inherited constant), then entities 
in the Game of Breaking Gridlock will attempt to break 
gridlock (that is the objective of the game) by 
<ins>underminement</ins>. In an open world, members of 
group D will seek to undermine one another by 
possession and possibly utility of specific gains, reaped 
from a "middle ground" through a feedback loop. The 
"middle ground" is a composite prediction by group D on 
what would enable at least one entity to "outperform" others. 
Outperformance would finally and directly enable the advancement 
or fulfillment of at least one entity's interests for a broken 
gridlock. 

![image info](./images/gbg_diagram2.PNG)

**GBGD2:** Graphical illustration of a functional feedback loop between
group D and a "middle ground", a composition of each entity's 
predicted source for their underminement activity. 

Diagram GBGD2 is not foolproof as an illustration for 
underminement by members of group D. If perhaps only one
entity does not conserve their activity for their constant
interests, the losses from their failure to conserve would
transfer over to another entity in group D. The gravity of 
change from such zero-sum transfer increases the likelihood
of a broken gridlock due to the reason of <ins>failed 
conservation</ins>. By complication through diversification
of semantics, the definition of an entity's "performance" 
is extended to explicitly include its conservative (retentive)
power in its autonomy (resources and capabilities). 
In diagram GCGD2, the arrow from group D to "middle ground" 
G is a query (request) by some arbitrary set of D's 
entities for resources, physical or otherwise, to aid 
in the entities' ulterior objective of underminement. 
And the "middle ground" G responds by a function that 
outputs a product (physical or otherwise) back to members 
of D selected by G as the receiver of the product.

Diagram GCGD3 shows the process of underminement from 
start to potential "finish". The blue nodes are labeled 
$P_i \rightarrow I_i$. The possible achievement of 
outcome $P_i$ (fulfillment of entity $E_i$'s interest)
is through the gains, made through underminement feedback
loops with the unrepresented "middle ground", that lends
to the entity's outperformance (by gridlock arrangement norms). 
And outperformance makes barriers against the achievement 
of the interest $I_i$ naturally cede.

![image info](./images/gbg_diagram3.PNG)

**GCGD3:** Prospects of underminement by members of gridlocked group D.

There are a few questions for the thinker to ponder on 
in this Game of Breaking Gridlock. How and why would 
there be encouragement for entity activity to be 
redirected towards a middle ground? To answer that 
the encouragement was instantiated due to the drive 
of at least one member of a gridlocked group G to 
break gridlock is a roundabout answer. How would the 
gains reaped from the "middle ground" and transferred
to selected members of group G be utilized for partial 
advantage, on the condition that gridlocking conditions
prohibit the utility of advantage, that is, resources 
and qualities not present in the initial autonomous 
conditions of the group's members? As for the possible
future, abstraction by the Game of Breaking Gridlock 
opens the doors to the undefined. 

## How Obtuse Judgments Can Count <a name="p6"></a>

What does the word "judgment" mean when there are
no consequences from the occurrence of it in the 
sentient mind? The concept of "judgment" is 
associated with a decisive tone, maybe consequence
or consequences, maybe a conclusion to merely 
believe in if not to uphold and advance. The 
explicit mention of associated terms, such 
as consequences and conclusions, belonging 
to judgments is necessary to discuss the topic 
in this outline of cognitive processes.

A sentient being can "perceive" something. 
And then that same being forms a judgment of it. 
This sequence follows the logic of forming 
conclusions, or at least informed hypotheses, 
derived from experience formatted as the 
"perception". Note the usage of the additional 
word "informed" as a descriptor for these 
hypotheses, since a "hypothesis" is very frequently
defined simply as an "educated guess". As 
funny as an "educated hypothesis" sounds, 
the phrase would go against teachings of its 
definition as an "educated guess" on the 
premise of redundancy. To add on more to these 
elaborations in a way that is besides the point, 
this statement makes no implicative jab on any 
education system.
 
The simple logic that judgmental processes 
are borne from perceptual ones falls very 
short of capturing the full extent of complex 
cognitive phenomena. <ins>Information-flow engineering</ins>,
basically data engineering that is directed 
(maybe by force) into a sentient being's cognition, 
results in the frequent state that is the sentient 
being forming judgmental functionaries to streamline
the innumerable cases of information into categories 
much fewer than the original number of cases, 
granted that the being has learning capabilities 
in the realm of informatic-efficiency. With learning 
capabilities, the easiness in mentally computing 
or concocting certain tasks, over the frequency 
of practice through exposure, results in generalizations 
(classifications) that have an acceptable rate of error,
acceptance due to the gains in efficiency, with respect 
to the possible information cases to be received. In 
machine-learning theory, this dynamic is termed 
<ins>bias-complexity tradeoff</ins>. 

There is some perspective to be written on 
bias-complexity tradeoffs. Definitions provided by 
orthodox machine-learning experts define the bias as 
something inclusive of the error term (typically 
a decimal in standard algebraic equations). The 
complexity of the solution, meaning the amount 
of effort required to obtain the solution and 
its final form, removes the bias. The complexity 
of the solution may also lead to over-fitting, 
a technical term used to describe solutions 
that are virtually perfect (no error in 
performative tasks such as classification and 
regression) for subsets of the entire space of 
information cases and also, meanwhile, would 
or did perform poorly for different subsets 
of the same space of information cases.
The orthodox definition of bias-complexity 
tradeoff sets the bias' identity as akin to the 
error-term. However, outside of the orthodox 
definition provided by machine-learning experts, 
bias could be regarded as an "open-ended" 
component for a solution, synonymously a "freedom" 
for an agent to make selections, in the remaining but 
diversified options, for their own "full solution". 
And the possibly high complexity of a solution, 
minimizing the error by the tradeoff dynamic, produces 
practical biases, those that produce a high rate 
of error on some subsets of the entire possible
information space. This commentary on the 
perspective of the concept of bias-complexity 
tradeoff swaps the roles of bias and complexity,
from formulation towards the solution (meditation,
introspection) to actualizing (non-rehearsing utility) 
on the solution.

One broad area of complication in fully describing
judgmental processes is its influence on 
perception. One thing that can be stated for certain 
is: the extent in existence and use of judgmental 
functionaries regarding cognition has a correlative 
influence on perceptual tasks that take place after 
said functionaries have taken root. This statement 
can be used to buttress idioms such as a sentient 
being "sees what they want to see and hears what 
they want to hear". Judgmental functionaries seem to 
manifest themselves in symptomatic effects such as
the primary symptom of filtration processes against
the intake from information flow.

There are two over-arching classifications of 
cognitive processes revolving around judgments and 
perceptions, based on the relative ordering 
of their occurrence. There is the judgment-first
and the perception-first model. Before moving on 
to notions on these two models, mentions on 
personality tests such as the famous Myer-Briggs 
test are a helpful visitation. The Myer-Briggs 
test is used as a criteria for classifying 
personalities by thought processes. There are 
exactly sixteen personalities, due to four categories 
such that each category has two variants. This 
section is only interested in the last of the 
four categories, with two variants of perceiving 
and judging types. This specific test assigns 
a personality as either perceptive or judgmental
by the predominance (of frequency) of one of 
the two traits over the other. And the frequencies 
collected are through questions asked that are 
supposed to yield "genuine" answers. 

Shifting focus back to the two models for cognitive 
processes that is judgment or perception first,
there are unique advantages possessed by each 
model. The judgment-first model is a more defensive
model against arbitrary information flow, in which 
the labeling of "more defensive" is derived from 
the greater magnitude in filtration process 
utility over that of the perception-first model.
There is still the unanswerable question (in the 
general realm) of the effectiveness in the higher 
defensive posturing encouraged by this model.
This model is also ironically more action-oriented 
than its counterpart. To form a conclusion or at 
least a decision quicker than by the counterpart 
model that emphasizes perception (indiscriminate 
intake from information flow) could very well be 
an advantage in cases where threats or flaws are 
well-recognized and thus anticipated ahead of 
time. Judgment-first models intend to bar
advantages by threats that would have been given
wider and deeper opportunities, due to the 
sentient being's openness, for inflicting fault.

The exclusive gains from perception-first models 
are judgmental processes that are fuller in breadth 
and scope because of the typically higher intake from 
information-flow, given the patience that is 
extra time required. Not all tasks (mental or otherwise)
demand an immediate consequential action afterwards. 
But perception-first models may not yield effective 
solutions in a timely manner based on the nature 
of their specific information-flow intake. For example, 
if the same errors in the form of patterns similar to 
one another are present in the intake, perception-first 
models must know to "cut the losses" of additional 
experience. To further exemplify, perhaps it is not 
the value derived from more open information-flow
intake that is gainfully important, but that of 
proceeding to action.

An obvious thought on these two models is that 
there can be a "balancing act" between them. 
There is no physical law on cognition, based on 
prior evidence yielded through empirical 
studies, that states that exactly one model is 
to be used for the duration of a sentient being's 
existence. On the premise of design behind the 
Myer-Briggs test, it is conjectured that preferring 
one cognitive model over the other at some critical 
spans in time (such as the beginning) may skew overall
cognitive processes through the span of a 
sentient being's time in ways that contradict the 
"balancing act" it desires, goals for a middle 
ground of impartiality. The corrective cycles
involved in judgment-first models may yield more 
pronounced changes in acquired solutions, due to 
the obvious possibility of drastic differences in
the samples from arbitrary information-flow intake. 

Obtuse judgments can count in cases in which there 
is the lack of immediate consequences against the sentient 
being, the practitioner of the obtuse judgment, if they 
are to acquire dominion over their "immediate vicinity". 
The acquisition of dominion gives credence to the practitioner 
of the obtuse judgment. And maybe in contentious affairs, 
those that have already established dominion through 
their obtuse judgments will find their foe weak and 
beneath them. The foe may have relied on a perception-first 
model in their daily practices, only to discover that their 
information-flow intake was not substantial enough to 
adversely compare with those holding obtuse judgments against 
them.

Here is a musing on what superiorities of two 
classifications in thought processes, with no definitive 
answer for that would require specific examples. 

## To Be Revered by What <a name="p7"></a>

The word "reverence" carries attitudes and beliefs
of genuine respect for a noun, typically a sentient
being. An attempt is made in this section to detail
what reverence means in practice, and its alternative
analogues, intended to appear as the authentic, to shift
well-meaning focus towards them. 

There is a similar word to reverence that may act as 
a starting step towards the belief in it. The word is 
"reference". In a world of utmost connectivity, 
strong connectivities between polarities (maybe
the only way the polarity preserves its full identity)
and between variants (higher orders of difference), 
a reference can be a or the source from which the 
connectivity stems from. A reference could 
also be a derivation of a source. The connectivity, 
once put in existence, can be shared in some variable 
manner outside of the full control of the reference as 
the possible source. The choice to acknowledge connectivity 
between two seemingly different objects matters in 
the context of identification by cognitive functions. 

Here are a few broad classifications of attributes for 
references:
- duplicate (indistinguishable to its "source"), 
- complement (requires the "source" to be perceived as incomplete in the sense that the 
  reference can aid as an additive towards its fullness),
- variant (distinguishable from the "source", but related 
  to it in ways perceivable by select observers).

In input-output computational network models, with the 
inputs given the freedom of arbitrary definition 
(although the networks may immediately reject the 
inputs if they are to violate network input conditions), 
cognitive tasks take place by way of information 
transmitting from element to element of the network. 
An element of a typical network may be a node 
(station,endpoint,unit) or an edge (connective piece 
between any two nodes). Each element is attached to
some function that serves as a condition for how 
the information being transmitted is utilized. 
Common utility purposes include transforming the 
specific information into another form (of a 
different data space) or a variant in the same 
space, as well as routing the information to 
another node or along another edge.

Some common roles for sources of references, using the 
data format of networks, are  <ins>centers</ins>, 
<ins>sinks</ins>, and <ins>deflectors</ins>. Each of these
roles are illustrated in the proceeding diagrams.

![image info](./images/ref_diagram_star.PNG)

**REFSTAR:** A <ins>star</ins> graph, with the source (red) in the "center".

![image info](./images/ref_diagram_peripheral.PNG)

**REFPER:** A <ins>line</ins> graph, with the source (red) at the extreme peripheral, the 
"sink".

![image info](./images/ref_diagram_alternative.PNG)

**REFALT:** An <ins>arbitrary</ins> graph, with a reference (red) acting as a "deflector"
against the source (labeled S).

In diagram REFALT, reference $R_4$ is able to deflect information 
flow from nodes $R_0$ and $R_1$ that would have gone to source 
$S$ if there was no connection (edge) shared by both $R_0$ 
and $R_1$ with $R_4$.

Some formulaic notation is called for in discussing the 
classifications for references based on their attributes. 
Suppose an element $E$ has these arbitrarily defined attributes: 
$[A_0,A_1,A_2,A_3]$. Any of these attributes can be 
"transformed" into another by the use of any of these 
categories of functions: $C^{(?)}$ (complementary), $D^{(?)}$ 
(duplicative), and $V^{(?)}$ (variant). These transformative 
functions are denoted by "power of question mark" since there 
is no consideration for the control of the material and effort 
required in their functions to achieve their wanted 
metrics.

The table below shows an element $E$ 
as the source, its two references, and pertinent 
attributes for each. 

| Element | Attributes |
| ------- | ---------- |
| $E$ | $A_0,A_1,A_2,A_3$ |
| $R_0$ | $C^{(0)}(A_1),D^{(0)}(A_2),A_4$ |
| $R_1$ | $C^{(1)}(A_3),A_5,A_6$ |

**ATTRT:** Attributes for element $E$ and two references to it.

The task of distinguishing an element from another
by mathematical approaches is frequently based on 
on functions similar to the arithmetic operation of
subtraction. For any two elements, the qualities that 
distinguish them are  

$\triangle(E_0,E_1) = E_1 - (E_0 \bigcap E_1)$,   
$\triangle(E_1,E_0) = E_0 - (E_0 \bigcap E_1)$.  

These two formulae oversimplify the computation 
of distinguishing two elements based on their 
specific attributes, but they do serve as a 
typical template for further specification.
Specific differentiation between two attributes such 
as $A_0$ and $D^{(?)}(A_0)$ are left up to design
alongside verification for their methodological 
correctness. The first formula distinguishes $E_1$ 
from $E_0$ by the attributes exclusive to $E_1$, 
and the second vice-versa.

Qualities of information-flow activity are a 
central topic for observation in <ins>computational 
reference networks</ins>, a category of reference 
networks. Flow of information requires direction
along edges if the information is to not be jammed 
in transmission. Direction of flow can change in 
these networks, and the mechanisms for these are 
later specified in more constrained terms. Edges 
are typically left open to be bidirectional (in 
other words, undirected) so that there is possibility 
for change of flow in spans of activity deemed 
necessary, such as cycling of information back to 
nodes and edges already traveled for corrective 
or reflective purposes. There is **exactly one 
of two responsibilities for a <ins>node recognized 
as the source</ins>**. These two responsibilities 
are <ins>material</ins> and <ins>functional</ins> 
utility. The terms "role" and "responsibility", 
as categorical terms in this section used to describe 
how sources and references work, are not synonymous 
with each other, although there is a lot of overlap 
in interpretation between these two terms in plainspeak. 
Before defining these two responsibilities by way of 
written language, these next diagrams below on common 
information-flow patterns allow room for familiarity. 

![image info](./images/inforef_diagram_deflector.PNG)

**INFOREF1:** Diagram shows a computational reference 
network. The source node $S$ has the responsibility of 
being a <ins>functional utility</ins> to the other nodes (references)
that have passed it information. Source $S$ also acts the
role of a <ins>deflector</ins> of information against 
node $R_4$, symbolized by the strikethrough of connections 
$(R_0,R_4)$ and $(R_4,R_5)$. Source $S$ is also a <ins>sink</ins> for 
functional utility by all involved references,
$\{R_0,R_1,R_2,R_3,R_5,R_6\}$, in the transmission of 
information to it. Last but not least, source $S$ acts 
as an <ins>anti-center</ins> for the origins of information
flow, since it is to function according to some way by 
information it did not have prior to the information's 
receipt by the references. 

Computational reference networks complicate the categorization 
of nodes by their roles. In diagrams REFSTAR,REFPER, and REFALT,
the undirected connections between nodes allow for easier 
recognition of their most probable role, based on metrics 
concerning node-to-node distance and centrality. The additional 
feature of adding directions to these edges (connections) for 
information flow, without consideration for more network 
features, allows the possibility for any node connected to the 
network to appear and act as any role.

![image info](./images/inforef_diagram_star.PNG)

**INFOREF2:** Computational reference network with source S having 
a <ins>material responsibility</ins> of transmitting information to
all connected references.

Diagrams INFOREF1 and INFOREF2 provide visual basis on the 
two responsibilities of a node in computational reference 
networks. The responsibilities of material and functional 
utility are reduced to the relative direction of flow from 
a node acting as a source in these networks. Material utility 
consists of negative flows of information from the node acting 
as a source, and functional utility consists of the opposite 
that is positive flows. No specific conditions are set in 
computational reference networks for the endpoint receivers 
of the information from these positive and negative flows. 
There are innumerable ways in which computational reference 
networks can be used. Networks, especially in computing, 
operate by arbitrarily-defined rules. Many in operation 
today are used in tasks such as communication in social 
circles or supercomputing. These tasks will not be explored
by way of computational reference networks since they may 
require a lot of  proprietary real-life information, and 
must require technical details too minute for the wanted 
broadness in this section. 

One way is through the Game of Reference Identification (GRI). 
Specific calculations in this game can be extensive enough 
to be very difficult to comprehend in a short amount of time.
The Game of Reference Identification bases itself on a 
computational reference network. There is exactly one source 
and at least one reference that is not the source. All nodes 
in the computational reference network are connected to each 
other, although there may not be an edge shared between every 
pair. Every node has some set of attributes and also a function 
that acts on information it receives. Every edge also has a 
function that acts on information it receives. 

A third-party agent $D$ has a criteria $C$, also the 
starting information for the flow process in a computational
reference network. Agent $D$ first gains entry into the 
computational reference network at an arbitrary node. 
The agent is to identify the source in the network. From 
a probabilistic perspective, any node has an equal probability
of being the source. With the criteria $C$ by the agent, there
is the potential for the agent to narrow down the possibilities
for the source. The agent can travel to each node in the network
by way of edges. For each piece of the network (either a node or edge),
its associated function uses comparative measures between element (node) 
attributes to process information that is originally criteria $C$ 
by third-party agent $D$. If the information satisfies some 
condition, not yet specified, by the comparative measures, then an 
action is taken with regards to the node or edge. If action 
is to be taken on a node, then one of two events may occur:
- the node is accepted by agent $D$ as the source, 
- the node routes the information passed to it along an edge. 
  
And for action to be taken on an edge, there is the primary 
one of routing the information along it to the node at the 
end of it (represented as nodes touching arrows in diagrams 
INFOREF1 and INFOREF2).

On the format for any criteria by any third-party agent $D$, the 
criteria is information on the source that may be entirely 
incorrect. The criteria consists of 
- a sequence $\overrightarrow{A} = \{A^{(D)}_0,\dots,A^{(D)}_l\}$, 
  values of the attributes hypothesized by $C$ to be the correct
  answer, 
-  a non-negative integer that serves as the number of unknown 
  attributes, 
- a pairwise attribute-distinguisher function that compares two 
  values of an attribute $A_i$,
  $F_{-}(A^{(?)}_i,A_i) = q.$  
  The value q is typically a real number, due to the space of 
  real numbers serving as a continuous spectrum for magnitudes 
  in differences, such that if $q=0$, then there is no difference 
  between the two attribute values.

Each member of this list can be modified by agent $D$ to suit 
the information it has received on what it thinks the source is. 
An example is called for to depict how agent $D$ may operate in 
the Game of Reference Identification. Consider this criteria. 

| Attribute Hypothesis | No. of Unknown | Distinguisher Function |
| -------------------- | -------------- | ----------- |
| $C^{(q)}(A_0),V^{(q)}(A_1),A_2$ | 3 | $F_{-}$ |

**CRI1:** Criteria $C$ for a third-party agent D; (2 x 3). 

| Element | Attributes |
| ------- | ---------- |
| $E$ | $A_0,V^{(E)}(A_1),C^{(E)}(A_1),D^{(E)}(A_2)$ |
| $R_0$ | $C^{(R_0)}(A_0),A_1,A_2,A_3,A_4,A_5$ |
| $R_1$ | $C^{(R_1)}(A_3),A_5,A_6$ |

**ATTRT2:** Table of elements and their attributes, such that $E$ 
is the source and $R_0,R_1$ are references.  

![image info](./images/crn_one.PNG)

**CRN1:** A computational reference network of elements in table ATTRT2.
Note the function sets $F_{?}$,associated with nodes, and $G_{?}$ associated 
with edges. 

Every associated function of a network's piece takes
as input the running criteria of a third-party agent. 
The term "running" is a descriptor for a variable 
that undergoes changes applied by one or more outside 
factors in a duration of activity. 

The functions in the network of diagram CRN1 could go
as such. 

| Function | Formula | Activation | 
| ------- | ----------- | ---------- | 
| $G_{S,R_1}$ | $\emptyset$ | pass to end |
| $G_{R_1,S}$ | $\emptyset$ | pass to end |
| $G_{S,R_0}$ | $\emptyset$ | pass to end |
| $G_{R_0,S}$ | $\emptyset$ | pass to end |

**FEDGEG:** Table for edge functions, their formula and activation; (5 x 3).  

The null formulae for these functions denote any information 
transmitting along them freely transmits to the corresponding 
endpoints of the edges. For each of the node functions, 

$$\begin{equation}
F_{S}(\overrightarrow{A}) = 
     \begin{cases}
      \text{transmit to $R_1$} & \text{if $\overrightarrow{A}$ equals S,} \\ 
      \text{transmit to $R_0$} & \text{otherwise.} \\ 
     \end{cases}
\end{equation}$$

$$\begin{equation}
F_{R_0}(\overrightarrow{A}) = 
     \begin{cases}
      \text{transmit to $S$} & \text{if coin toss is heads,} \\ 
      \text{terminate flow} & \text{otherwise.} \\ 
     \end{cases}
\end{equation}$$

$$\begin{equation}
F_{R_1}(\overrightarrow{A}) = 
     \begin{cases}
      \text{transmit to $S$} & \text{if coin toss is tails,} \\ 
      \text{switch flow of edge $(S,R_1)$, and transmit on it} & \text{otherwise.} \\ 
     \end{cases}
\end{equation}$$

Functions $F_{R_1},F_{R_0},F_{S}$ are simple, in the sense that 
they merely make decisions of routing information that their 
respective elements receive based on either an attribute-equality 
operator, in $F_{S}$, and for the others, a "coin toss"-like 
function determining the next node destination for the 
information. In the cases of $F_{R_0}$ and $F_{R_1}$, there is 
also the node functionalities of switching flow direction 
belonging to an edge or terminating flow. In termination of 
flow, the third-party agent must make a decision on what 
element it has computed to be the source, for information 
flow has terminated. 

In more complex cases, node or edge functions can act as 
modifiers onto the distinguisher function in use by the 
third-party agent. This stipulation assumes said 
third-party agent does not have full control over its 
criteria that it uses in search for the source. These 
kinds of functions are something that can be termed 
<ins>degenerative coupling functions</ins>, functions 
that influence the behavioral variables of another 
function in such a way that that function outputs values 
different from before the modification. 

Activity on the computational reference network in 
diagram CRN1 could go something like that found in 
this table.

| Timestamp | Node Location | Action | 
| --------- | ------------- | ------ | 
| 0 | $R_0$ | pass to $S$ |
| 1 | $S$ | pass to $R_1$ |
| 2 | $R_1$ | switch flow of edge $(S,R_1)$,take edge |
| 3 | $S$ | cannot pass to $R_1$,terminate flow |

**ACTLOG1:** Four transmissions of information $C$, the criteria used 
by third-party agent $D$. $D$ must decide which is the source element
after this termination. 

An arbitrary feature that can be added to computational 
reference networks for any third-party agent is cease
information flow after a specific number of edges 
the agent has traveled. For instance, if threshold for 
cessation is exactly 1 edge, then the third-party 
agent has exactly two node options, based on information 
flow, to choose as the source. But it could still 
guess, with no knowledge acquired through the information 
flow, that one of the remaining nodes is the source. 

Next, here is one possibility for agent $D$'s 
distinguisher function, $F_{-}$, and its attribute 
hypothesis $\{C^{(q)}(A_0),V^{(q)}(A_1),A_2\}$.

$$\begin{equation}
F_{-}(\overrightarrow{A}) = 
     \begin{cases}
      \text{accept as source} & \text{if 6 attributes} \\ 
      \text{reject as source} & \text{otherwise.} \\ 
     \end{cases}
\end{equation}$$

Using $F_{-}$, agent $D$ recognizes $R_0$ as the source 
when, much to its chagrin by facts, the source is $S$. 
More advanced cases of distinguisher functions 
by a third-party involve the concept of learnability
through trial-and-error, that is, improving the 
accuracy in distinguishing a source from the reference
based on modifying the running distinguisher function 
(mutable, in this case) to fit for an output that 
recognizes $S$ as the source. Generalized description 
for the Game of Reference Identification is concluded 
with this example of a computational reference network 
in diagram CRN1. 

On the idea of reverence briefly mentioned at the 
beginning of this section, some notions on the idea 
of reverence not yet discussed can be put forth after 
elaboration on computational reference networks. 
Reverence can be further described as a devotion by 
one, a devotion that is more selfless for the revered 
than not, and is also psychological phenomena 
by one that holds the revered in higher esteem 
and light than even themself.

A computational reference network can, by way of 
numerical spaces such as the real numbers (where 
greater numbers represent greater influence), 
quantitatively model reverence. A typical network
formation is based on a star graph. For every 
reference node connected to the source by way of 
some edge, the associated node and edge functions
are based on pairwise-comparator functions between
some wanted (ideal,desired) attributes, such that 
those attributes may not actually be possessed 
by the references, and the attributes belonging 
to the source. Information-flow patterns, in the 
context of responsibility, tend to oscillate 
between material and functional utility. The 
material utility, negative flow of information 
away from the source, is used by references to
possibly proliferate (promote and duplicate by 
transmission) to other elements. Then these other 
elements may hold functions that are similar to 
the initial references of the source. And the 
cycle of proliferation may continue until there 
are conditions that constrain the process to 
a stall in growth of number of references, and 
perhaps the number of references shrink by way 
of severing or altering connections for 
information flow in matters of material and 
functional utility with respect to the source.

![image info](./images/crn_two.PNG)

**CRN2:** A computational reference network, with $S$ as the 
source. Functions $M_{?}$ are for material utility to 
the references, and functions $F_{?}$ are for functional utility.
The green node represents the function that $S$ acts on 
in information flow that is functional utility. Source $S$
is, in synonymous terms, a <ins>reverence node</ins>. 

The Game of Reference Identification is not that similar to a 
needle-in-the-haystack problem. The task of identifying
the source and finding the needle appear to be similar 
in the sense that some unique object must be found. 
But for the latter objective, the haystack problem typically 
requires large scales of information to become difficult 
enough for third parties to identify the needle. The third 
parties in needle-in-the-haystack problems have to resort 
to tactics such as brute force, and these tactics require 
a scale of resources that correlates by some proportion 
to the size of the haystack. 

## Curse by Pre-emptive Doxing <a name="p8"></a>

The newspeak involved in political warfare continues 
its evolution to this day. The word "doxing", having made 
its way into the English dictionary, means to distribute 
information that was intended by certain interests to be 
completely privatized, supposed to be known only by those
interests that prohibit such distribution of said 
information. 

In the Game of Reference Identification, the act of 
"doxing" could entail giving a third-party agent the 
correct criteria for identifying the source, via communicating 
the source's precise attributes. In the Game of Breaking 
Gridlock, the doxxer (they that act by doxing) provides
supplementary material, containing knowledge advantageous
to the recipient, to specific entities as partisan
support for their interests. In the Game of Tree-Trimming,
the doxxer could provide information that leads to the
most "ideal" decisions made by the cutting agent. In the 
Game of Crypto or Gibberish, the doxxer could provide 
the correct contextual or literal information on the message 
to the correspondent (Agent C) and interpreter (Agent A). 
In the Game of Varying Coercion, the doxxer could help
agents of Silent Trigger. These are some very well-known 
aims of doxxers. This statement can very much go without
any citations of real-life cases. 

The idiom of the needle-in-the-haystack, analogized in 
the end of the last section (To Be Revered by What), 
makes for a safe and conservative starting step for 
discussing the topic of doxing. What if, in adaptive 
systems, the structure nicknamed the "haystack" grows 
to be insurmountably large in the sense that the doxed 
information poses no advantage whatsoever? Doxing 
does not necessarily lead to a certainty in increasing 
the probability of accomplishing some objective in 
these games mentioned. Doxing can serve as an aggravating 
force. The attempt to disseminate information, without knowing
the certainty of its correctness or the consequences of
its use, can lead to dismal answers given to those questions.
Alas, the intentions and actualization of achieving some
aims, via knowledge thought to be advantageous by one or 
both the recipient and sender in doxing, are essentially 
specific semantics under the Game of Crypto or Gibberish.

The superstitious notion of a curse, phenomena perceived to 
be some nature that bears some effect, all this without 
empirical reasoning and additionally power ascribed
to a foreign/alien/deitified force, could very well be the 
result of recipes heavily reliant on doxing. Suppose these 
patterns perceived to be malicious by some, those that hold 
the patterns to be curses, fall under games akin to those
already mentioned in this section. 

Interpret events one step past the five senses in cases such 
as disintegration of the state, feudal republics, "staged 
accidents", ultimate mysteries, and other dysfunctions of 
madness down the darkened list, and to call these kinds of 
events curses falls under the conclusion that is an 
opinionated acceptance without rediscovery, bound to the 
lack of light.

## A Simple Template For Expectations of Cost <a name="p9"></a>

The value of every cost (typically a number in the space of 
real numbers), when presented to some audience, is expected 
by one or both the presenter and the audience to be of an 
authentic measure, according to metrological processes 
recognized as objective. There is a difference between 
the value of a cost and the value of a fact, typically 
presenting themselves in material forms that are agreed
upon by conventional and well-known methodologies to 
zero down room for possible advocacy for conflicting 
valuation. If material forms cannot be acquired on 
certain facts, then there are alternatives such as 
replication, retelling, and group consensus as proofs 
by argument. Cost can be as scant to the solidity of 
facts as speculation without any mechanism geared 
towards correctness. Cost is a judgment of some body 
of facts, and these bodies of facts can be collections 
of bodies of opinions converted into numerical frequencies. 
Costs can then be understood as condensation of 
subjective interpretation of some body of facts 
into singular values, in the image of fact. 

Some inklings on expectations are first put forth. And 
these inklings are used to describe a simple template 
for expectations of cost. A foremost pillar to rely on
for expectations is the past, given the condition that 
there was proper accounting on pertinent events and 
objects of said past and this proper accounting has 
survived to the present time. With this condition 
satisfied, the past is a conservative source to refer
to. The conservative source, even in cases where there
are falls and faults, serve as templates for understanding
in manners such as present-time predictive and referential 
tasks. A second opinion of the past could directly open 
the possibility to entertain it as something to be 
revised based on additional information received, or 
something that certainly can be interpreted differently 
using the information already possessed. Setting the 
past as the conservative source (the "axis") for 
relativistic understanding of present-time costs is
not as grounded in certainty as those appreciative of 
the past may hope to be. 

What is the future in terms of cost? With no regards 
for fictional depictions of utopia necessary, the 
future is thought of by some to be an ideal to be 
worked for through risk-averse practices. Or is the 
future an open-ended question, filled with great 
possibilities for advances through stochastic 
experimentation? 

In the paradigm of machine-learning, as sophisticated 
as the most state-of-the-art algorithms the field 
has produced, there is one of a few important subproblems. 
The subproblem is <ins>supervised learning</ins>. 
It is conducted by computational processes, 
using data already annotated using descriptors agreed 
upon by the supervisor to be correct, to "learn" 
solutions for the data (tagged by descriptors) in 
a possible space of solutions. Supervised learning 
is a concept that can certainly accomodate the 
divide between expectations of cost with the 
"actualities" of cost. To maintain generality of 
discussion, needless for the nuances of mathematics, 
the values of cost can be dichotomized into paired 
values: (the expected, the actual). This constitutes 
a constant calibrative process to maintain the 
"factuality" of cost. Table EAST1 shows a modified 
version of the cost to resources by Silent Trigger, 
in the Game of Varying Coercion. The cooperative and the 
actor behind Silent Trigger do not know the value of 
costs associated with their two respective possibilities. 

| ~~ | Effective Cooperative | Ineffective Cooperative |
| --- | ---------- | ------ |
| Bull's Eye | (-3,-4),(-12,-15) | (-1000,-2000),(-50,-30) |
| Missed Mark | (-30,-29),(-100,-100) | (-1200,-800),(-1000,-300) |

**EAST1:** The table ST1 of section Situational Engineering, each pair of 
values dichotomized into (expected,actual) format; (2 x 2).

One major goal of this template, already quite well-known 
and taught in educational settings on applied mathematics, 
is to reduce the disorientation from judgments, thought to 
rest soundly on condensation of quantitative information, 
that would lead to negatively consequential decisions on 
a ghastly magnitude. 

Learnability of any problem can pose a security issue to 
the conservative source, mentioned earlier in this section. 
If disorientation of a judgment, quantified as big differences
in values between the expected and actual, does not lead to 
adverse effects for those that depend on the judgment 
in some relevant span of time, then the disorientation 
could become a permanent substitute for the orientation 
(also referred to in this section as the conservative 
source, the "axis"). The security issue is the removal 
of the conservative source that some if not many at the 
"beginning" strongly upheld as the standard. 

## The Effectiveness of Imagined Fallibilities <a name="p10"></a>

What is left to the imagination may stay in the 
immediate and constrained realm of the imagining.
The extrema, holding the range for this thing 
called imagination, is so wild and varied, and 
typically discussed openly (but how honestly is 
another question) only by drunkards and deceivers.
Imagination is one of those things that require
a source for the thinking behind it, and behind 
said source, a dampening agent who may be called 
a pessimist by those that do not share their 
views. The pathologically optimistic do have 
imaginations that mostly stay unrealized in 
a structured society. But this section does not
delve into the societal and neuroscientific 
aspects of imagination.  

Imagination as a quantitative factor, a factor 
that lends influence into an actual for an 
effect predictable by the nature of the <ins>automaton</ins>
it is connected to, is not as open-ended as 
unquantified half-formulated thoughts (the other 
half is what is not yet defined), multiple 
interpretations, and rudimentary principles that 
result in conflicting or specialized designs. 
Automata can be materializations of automata 
theoretics. And automata theoretics is the applied 
practice of automata theory. Automata theory, a 
subfield of computer science, provides the lexicon 
and methodology to model processes by way of a 
<ins>directed graph</ins>, similar to the 
computational reference graph defined and elaborated 
upon in the section To Be Revered by What. The
automata in this section are illustrations of 
selected circumstances possibly borne from 
the acceptance of imagined values. 

One use of imagined values is as a priming 
factor to activate an effect of an object or catalyze 
a sequence of events. The activated effect or event/s
is the actual that emerges from an imagined value. 
From a cognitive standpoint, an imagined value could 
take the form of a speculation or conjecture, possibly 
difficult to numerically represent, that transmits 
itself to agents capable of actions represented by 
the output of quantitative forms. The agents, upon 
their reception of the imagined value, validate 
the value through their group consensus, then takes 
some grouped sequence of actions based on the 
validation. In another case of use, imagined values 
provide "temporary immunity" to an acting agent 
in violating non-physical laws, rules that can be 
broken due to the physical potential but mostly 
remain abided by for some prescribed decorum 
such as social propriety. The "temporary immunity" 
dissipates after the acting agent has acted in some 
way resulting in the breaking of certain non-physical 
laws, and the agent is left to answer to the prescribed 
consequences of violating these non-physical laws.

**IM1:** Wanted objective in automaton is activation of black box. 
Only agent $B$ can activate blackbox through intermediary $C$.
Imaginary value $I$ is used to bypass security measures, denoted 
by edges striked through, by passing the mocked value of $B$ to
$C$. 

Diagram IM1 starts off at imaginary value $I$. If $I$ were to 
attempt to communicate with agent $B$, $B$ sends back a destroyer
function that deletes $I$. Agents $A$ and $B$ are in a coupling 
situation, such that each reflects their own value to the other
in a constant security loop. When $I$ sends a request to $A$ to
send back an "imaginary" reflection of $B$ to it, $A$ complies.
Then $I$ sends this "imaginary" value to the mocking agent $M$. 
$M$ mocks the reflection of agent $B$, sends the mocking to $C$, 
and $C$ activates the black box. The black box, in this automaton,
could have only been activated by $B$'s authorization through 
the intermediary $C$. Although $B$ cut connection to the 
intermediary, with the goal of eliminating any chance of activating
the black box, the black box was nevertheless activated. 

![image info](./images/imaginary_two.PNG)

**IM2:** Trap arrangement between Agent $C$ and imaginary 
value $I$ against agent $A_i$. Agent $C$ has the responsibility 
of sending the destroyer function $f_d$ to agent $A_i$ if 
it accepts communication from imaginary value $I$. 


If $I$ relays to agent $C$ non-null communication it 
received from $A_i$, agent $C$ proceeds to sending 
$f_d$ to $A_i$. In the connection between agent $A_i$
and imaginary value $I$, $A_i$'s continual rejection
of communication from $I$ means that value $v(A)$ 
sent to $C$ stays null, so that $C$ does not send 
the destroyer function after $A_i$. 

![image info](./images/imaginary_three.PNG)

**IM3:** Closed five-star network has two vulnerable 
ports, with agents $b_0$ and $b_1$ in charge of guarding
entry against outsider agents listed as threats. Using 
imaginary value $I$, outsiders $d_0$ and $d_1$ were able
to obscure their identities and bypass the guardian 
agents, thereby infiltrating the five-star network. 

![image info](./images/imaginary_four.PNG)

**IM4:** Adversarial agents $A_0,A_1,$ and $A_2$ are 
in a connected subnetwork to charge their power by 
function $f_t$. They use their combined energies to
channel it outwards against agent $D$. However, the 
imaginary value $I$ acts as an absorption buffer 
against the impacts of the loaded fire $F_l(i)$
from the $A_{i}$ agents. Targeted agent $D$ receives 
half of the loaded fire through buffer $I$. It 
redirects this neutralized value back to agent $A_2$,
in order to provide the adversarial agents with 
false positive feedback on their loaded fire. The
other half of the fire is directed from the imaginary 
buffer to the reactive site $R$. When reactive 
site $R$ acquires enough energy, it sends 
concentrated energy to the black box function. 
The black box function sends destroyer functions 
to each of the agents $A_0,A_1,$ and $A_2$ to 
neutralize them. 

![image info](./images/imaginary_five.PNG)

**IM5:** Imaginary value $I$ serves as a deludant to 
agent $A$'s goal of achieving destination $T$. Agent 
$A$ is deluded into reaching the failpoint $F$. 

Another area of noteworthy interest in which 
imaginary values produce effects is <ins>reproductive 
numerical structures</ins>. Two classifications of 
structures capable of "reproduction" are vectors, 
sequences of numbers, and matrices, sequences of 
numbers structured into a dimensional format greater 
than single dimension. The utility of imaginary 
values could behave differently from the standard 
imaginary number "i". As a reminder, the imaginary 
number "i" follows this multiplicative pattern:  
$[i,-1,-i,1].$  

In this section's definition of reproductive 
numerical structures, every index of the structure
is associated with a process function. Each process 
function has two components:   
1. a conditional function
2. a reproductive function that is applied to some 
   arbitrary indices of the numerical structure if 
   the conditional function is satisfied. 

This definition is rather scant and allows for 
practices open-ended in effects. The conditional 
function, for example, could involve more values 
outside of the number at the arbitrary index 
of focus. The reproductive function could add 
more numbers to the numerical structure, and 
in turn, modifies the size and possibly 
dimensionality of the numerical structure. The
reproductive function also does not have to take
effect on the same index/indices as those of the
conditional function activating it. The "imaginary 
values" are the conditional functions. Activation 
of the conditional function requires the pertaining 
"real" value/s of the numerical structure to 
satisfy its condition. Upon satisfaction, the 
effect of the "imaginary value" is application of 
the reproductive function.

## Shifty and Shifting Alliances <a name="p11"></a>

Connection as a continuity does not have a 
particularly wide opening for opportunity in a 
zero-sum world. The connection does or does
not exist. There is no task of making connections, 
competing for connections, and reaping of the 
ruins after breaking connections. Any ideal 
recognized in totally static connections would 
remain that way. Any questioning or dissidence
against the existence of these certain connections 
alongside predictable assertion (typically 
with an aggressive tone) for alternative 
connections that would split the two ends of 
said connections into their own non-intersectional
paths is viewed as fools' follies. A disregarding 
and cold response would be in order. What defiance 
can outmatch the truthfulness of something very much 
like physical law? There is no will that has not been 
grounded by hubris, and what ways stay contained by 
the powers that be.  

The consideration of fluidity in connective 
systems, which does not have to be mechanical 
or procedural, that are susceptible to fluid 
tendencies do behave in at least somewhat 
mechanical and procedural ways, even if the 
outcomes of participants may fare quite poorly 
with great variance against their wants and 
forecasts. Standard definitions of the word 
"alliance" will be explored, via network-like 
illustrations, of the broad branches by which 
fluid connections can express effect. Alliances 
are bodies of agreements between at least two 
entities. These agreements are evidenced and 
rationalized as granting benefits (positive or 
at least non-negative gains) in events that would 
produce disastrous outcomes if the agreements 
were not set in place to be executed for said 
events. First, some written mention of subjective 
but important questions is put forth. 

What is the cost of making and breaking alliances?
What premises, including non-physical properties, 
do alliances rest on? Are the premises that alliances
rest on mutable not only in minor exemplification 
but also in stark differences of principle? When 
do the potential effects of some alliances catalyze 
to fullness in outward projection, and what are the 
default states and activities of these alliances? What 
is the reliability of an alliance under the hierarchy 
or overarching objective of an outside force? These 
questions are difficult to comprehend in the sense 
that potent (condensed) answers can be fallaciously 
originated for fullness in explanation. Competent 
attempts have been made, and continue to be made. 
Instead of relying on the broadness of philosophical 
abstraction, or the efficiency of mathematical formulae, 
these attempts take the form of fictional/fictionalized 
works exploring character/organizational dynamics, 
events and feelings that convolute social divides 
established in the "beginning", unexpected gains 
made by those less fortunate by birth but somehow 
gained the "throne" and legitimacy through acting 
off of their personal desires against hierarchical 
imposition, and direct acknowledgment of the fragility 
of the social order upon one person's violation of 
their people's socioeconomic code. Recurring themes 
such as the acceptance of unavoidable tragedies 
(coming up past the horizon) just to live and pursue 
the desires of the soul and mind for the moment, the 
breaking of state or tribal bonds in the name of a 
greater ends with promises outweighing what monstrous 
means are necessary or even enjoyable to pursue, due 
to some growing distaste for a crumbling society 
led by those still stubborn enough to acknowledge 
the decadence of conserving the original paradigm, 
are also well-represented in works of foreign lands 
that went through their own reformation processes. 
As brilliant and illuminating as some of these works 
are, there are underlying attitudes in the more 
anarchist varieties expressing scorn for some laws 
(predominantly social/legal laws), no need for any 
serious one to acknowledge them or their regulators 
in charge of them, and what acknowledgment is given 
to these laws is relegated to contrarian hooligans 
and anti-establishment charlatans, a fitting and unserious 
resistance. These works tend to also draw their 
primary source of narration from the temporal perspective: 
an attitude of "there is really no past or present, 
but things just are so let things be, let us be...".
Lastly, sensuality and emotionalism taint the clarity
of understanding the principles (a lack of principle 
is a principle in these works) that drive characters 
and events to narrative climax and conclusions. 

To state that shifty and shifting alliances can be 
easily re-enacted through computational modeling 
will be expectedly challenged. Computational modeling 
does strip away a lot of convolution that is both 
"enjoyable" for readers of works, concerning shifty 
and shifting alliances, and horrendous for those that 
have experienced real-life events predominated by these 
types of alliances. Computational modeling does provide
bases easily comprehendable, although there is the 
lack of "completeness" (closure) that is found in 
specification and illumination, and just as importantly, 
the egregious faults that can come with mishandling by 
misconstruction through the usage of these bases.

These two diagrams show two graph units that can be 
used to represent one entity. 

![image info](./images/ssa_one.PNG)

**SA1:** Uniform graph unit, depicting an entity.


![image info](./images/ssa_two.PNG)

**SA2:** Hierarchical graph unit, depicting an entity.

The first diagram is a single node, a visualization of 
the wholeness of an entity under uniformity (attributes 
and values evenly dispersed). The second diagram consists 
of three nodes, with the blue node being the lead and 
the other two as sub-ordinate equals. These units for 
representing entities operate by "smart" network
functionalities, exhibited by autonomous actions taken 
after appropriate objectives and corresponding training 
have taken place with the aims of reliably deciding on 
maximally-gainful choices.

Hierarchical graph units are predominantly used 
in conceptualization and calculations, concerning alliances, 
in the remaining of this section. There is preference 
for this variant of unit, used in this discussion, 
since it allows for more sophistication through its 
three-ness of an entity, and calculations involving
three-node entities would also apply to one-node 
entities. Additional sophistication from three-node 
entities enacts effect from the structure's hierarchy 
(lead,sub-ordinates) and greater default connectivity 
(three-node VS. one-node) which, in turn, could lead 
to a scale of decisions multiple of those in 
one-node structures. There can, of course, be 
one-node entities with features (functions, 
programmatic rules) that enact hierarchical 
relations outside of the three-node model, but 
the vast diversification in this option oversteps 
the wanted base brevity in depicting alliances 
as changing networks. Innumerable network designs, 
for use in modeling automata of the variety that 
is connected systems (synonymously in this section, 
alliances), exist out of thin air. In order to contain 
the discussion in this section, there is no further 
mention of alternative models for graphical units, 
used as building blocks in complex connectivity. 

Entities, by the hierarchical graph unit, can be 
structured as a "mesh", the connectivity signifying 
an "alliance" between entities. To clarify for this 
section's design, though, an "alliance" does not 
have to necessarily have to exist as a mesh. For 
there to be an alliance between two entities, at 
least one of two conditions have to be satisfied:
- there is an edge connecting one node of one entity
  to another node of the other entity,
- there is a node shared by the two entities. 


![image info](./images/ssa_three.PNG)

**MESH1:** A mesh structure connecting 8 entities together. 
These 8 entities are "allied" with each other. The graph 
is entirely connected; there are no two nodes without a 
sequence of edges between them. Note the ambiguity in entities 
with more than one blue (lead) node. In these entities, there 
are "toss-up" procedures to yield the "lead" node. These procedures 
can produce different nodes for leads at different instances in time. 

Suppose there is a central factor $C$ of interest in an 
alliance of entities; $C$ is also deemed an "alliance" 
factor. Each entity is hierarchically organized as 
such in diagram SA2. When the central factor $C$ 
makes a connection to one of $E_0$ or $E_1$ via an 
edge, there are a few possibilities that can occur.
The category of open knowledge is quite relevant in 
interactions between entities. If there is open (instead 
of closed) knowledge between entities, then each entity 
knows every other entity's constituent nodes, and 
additionally knows what new connections, in the form 
of edges to nodes external to the entity, are 
established. Without open knowledge, a new connection 
to a network, which may be disconnected, is known
only to entities with an affected node. 

![image info](./images/ssa_four.PNG)

**MESH2:** The same mesh network from diagram MESH1, with 
an "alliance" factor $F$ connected to node $B$. 

The entities $\{B,a_0,b_0\}$, $\{B,a_0,a_1\}$, 
and $\{B,C,a_1\}$ are affected. Consider the case of 
closed knowledge, with respect to new connections, 
with these three entities. The other five do not know.
The lead node for the first two entities is $B$, but for 
the last, there are the candidates $B$ and $C$ as the 
lead. A safe assumption can be made that for any entity 
with a node size greater than one, a new connection to 
the entity will trigger calculations between the other 
nodes of said entity without the new connection. These 
calculations result in some broad categories of possibilities
with regards to node decisions. 

One category is change of rank. A new connection to a 
node of an entity can increase or decrease its rank with 
respect to the entity's remaining nodes. A lead node could
become a subordinate equal to another, and vice-versa. 
Another category is change of alliance. Recall this section's
formal definition of an alliance, with regards to graphs. 
A new connection from an "alliance" factor could severe 
existing alliances between entities. If there is a node 
shared between two entities, the entities may engage in a
toss-up to determine sole ownership of the shared node. 
The defeated entity, now consisting of only two nodes, 
is a broken one that no longer fits the three-node 
definition of a hierarchical unit. But if there is only 
an edge shared between two entities, then only the edge 
is shattered, separating them two into their own "domains". 
A new connection to an "alliance" factor could also form 
an "alliance" between two entities previously not allied. 
The naming of these two categories of change is somewhat
of misnomer. A change in rank within an entity could, in 
real-world applications, cause irreconciliable differences 
between the constituents of the entity that would impend 
on the entity's maintenance of unity. 

Another important aspect to consider is the design, 
intentional or not, of the "ripple" effect from the 
new connection to the "alliance" factor. With open 
knowledge, all involved entities are aware of the 
"alliance" factor's activity. The "alliance" factor 
produces changes onto the other entities not directly
connected to it, and these changes fall under the 
categories mentioned in the previous paragraph, change
of rank and change of alliance. Probability curves 
alongside pre-programmed rules and algebraic equations 
are standard mathematical tools in use to predict and 
replicate this kind of "ripple" effect onto networks. 
In diagram MESH2, entities $\{A,a_0,a_1\}$ and $\{A,D,a_1\}$
could attempt a negative change of alliance from some 
subset of the three involved entities connected to $F$, 
the "alliance" factor, due to what they judge as changes 
disadvantageous to their positioning to those entities. 

Open and closed knowledge are labels with quite complicated 
solutions for perfect-information objectives, usually specialized 
and cross-referenced in real-world practices. There is, however, 
a concise principle on how entities may operate in open versus 
closed knowledge environments. In open knowledge environments, 
the entities know what new connections to "alliance" factors 
occur. In closed knowledge environments, each entity would have 
to deduce if there are new connections to other entities 
based on its independent observation of the other entities' 
operational changes. To elaborate, does the other entity 
output higher or lower quality values? Does the other 
entity "behave differently" to its peers? If either one of
these two questions produce YES as answers, then there is 
a non-zero chance that the other entity may have established 
a connection to an "alliance" factor.  

![image info](./images/ssa_five.PNG)

**MESH3:** A result from the changes produced from a new 
connection to "alliance" factor $F$; see reference MESH2. 
Node $B$ is demoted to a clear sub-ordinate, with node 
$b_0$ assuming the lead. Dash lines signify previous 
connections now shattered. 

![image info](./images/ssa_six.PNG)

**MESH4:** "Alliance" factor $F$ connected to node $B$ results
in a new alliance with entity $\{B,b_0,b_1\}$, denoted by the dashed 
line. The green node $a_1$ is to assume the lead of the entity 
$\{A,a_0,a_1\}$ due to the entity's new alliance.

Some rules for "alliances" (for a jolly time, till kingdom 
come) are in order. This table below maps the action that a 
node takes alongside actions that other nodes take if $F$ 
connects to it. 

![image info](./images/ssa_seven.PNG)

**ALLT:** Mapping for the behavioral effects of nodes, in alliance 
MESH1, from connecting to "alliance" factor F. These are the 
pre-programmed (premeditated, planned, declared,et cetera) rules 
that every constituent of the alliance agreed upon if "alliance" 
factor $F$ were to establish a connection with one of them. 
Positive signs denote "promotion" of the node, meaning that
the node receives a higher standing in some metric. And negative signs
denote "demotion". 

Table ALLT shows the pre-programmed rules, in the form of 
planned actions taken by nodes, in the advent of "alliance" 
factor $F$ connecting to some node in the alliance. If knowledge 
is open, then each constituent knows $F$'s connection with 
certainty. Otherwise, as stated previously with closed knowledge,
each node except for the one that $F$ connects to has to deduce 
the connection, deduction being a probabilistic process with 
a minimal chance of accuracy with constituents that have 
well-guarded informational defense.

There are less than ten nodes in this situation, and even with 
these simple rules, for there are no hard numbers or formulae 
telling how to proceed with "promotion" and "demotion", these 
calculations are not so simple as solving standard algebraic 
systems of equations. In this conceptualization, the base 
assumption is that if there was no "alliance" factor to begin 
with, then the constituents of an alliance would go about 
their procedures as put forth beforehand in their agreements
constituting the alliance. The "alliance" factor serves as 
a body of sorts for the causality behind why and how an 
alliance can transform itself over time. There is no mention 
of what specific real-life nouns and verbs would act as an
"alliance" factor. The subjectivity could really go on for 
a while from there.

A prime aspect to consider for constituents of alliances, 
in spans of existence where an "alliance" factor plays 
an existing role, is the dichotomy of expected VS actual. 
The expected would be the body of agreements put forth by 
the constituents as a collective, for the alliance. And 
the actual is how those constituents act on their 
pre-programmed courses of actions. A little cliche mention 
on the application of free will in these constituents' 
actualization: for an entity, does their taking a 
different course of action from that prescribed in 
the formation of the alliance demonstrate it to be 
"more free than not"?

So far, this section has focused primarily on the effects of 
some arbitrary force called an "alliance" factor onto an 
alliance, consisting of connected entities. Focus is shifted 
from the perspective/s of the "alliance" to that of the 
"alliance" factor. There is a game in play here. It is called 
the Game of Sliding Alliances, to be elaborated on after 
some mention on pertinent variables. The "alliance" factor 
does not have to stay connected to one single node during 
a duration. There are a few big tenets in the decision for 
one to accept the inviting connection from another. These 
tenets do rest in the realm of pragmatism; as an aside, the 
heart and soul really know no bound in expression from 
a statistical observation. The tenets are 
- initial,median,potential gains as measurements of the 
  prospective connection's functionality, 
- initial,median,potential losses from establishing and 
  maintaining the connection, 
- risk assessment of the prospective connection, based on their 
  - historical records,
  - reception from peers. 

In the Game of Sliding Alliances, the objective of the 
"alliance" factor is to establish connection with each 
constituent of an alliance. The "one" mentioned in relation 
to the tenets previously listed is the current constituent 
of connection to the "alliance" factor. And the "alliance" 
factor can only be connected to one constituent, a node in 
the representational schema of graphs, at any single 
instance. Furthermore, for each constituent, the "alliance" 
factor is to accomplish some objective such as recreational 
experience (to set the start for long-lasting relations), 
gather information on the constituent (relations), and 
conduct exchanges (material/immaterial goods). Potential 
problems emerge for the "alliance" factor when they 
break connection to one constituent that goes against 
the constituent's expectations or interests, usually 
communicated to the "alliance" factor in some form,
with the goal of transparency for their defined commitment 
to the connection. Equivalently, the same problems may 
arise when the "alliance" factor establishes a connection 
to a different constituent that results in a previous 
constituent's judgment of being disadvantaged in some 
form. A sub-challenge for the "alliance" factor would 
be for them to justify their decisions, that which may 
violate terms set by each of the constituents they 
proceed to connect to in this game. These justifications 
could rest on areas such as the "alliance" factor's 
default state of lacklusterness, a state understandable 
from a mainstream-rational perspective to be impossibly 
conducive to fulfilling set terms of agreement, as well 
as deficits in prior constituent connections. And if 
these justifications appear plausible to a constituent, 
this constituent feeling violated of the terms it set 
with the "alliance" factor, then the constituent may 
fold (yield way) to the decision/s. 

Quantification is best implemented and continually revised 
for this Game of Sliding Alliances, after pertinent 
variables and their arbitrary orders of derivatives 
are accurately laid out. Vast subjectivity in real-life 
practices, including but not limited to stylistic 
preferences and stochastic decision-making principles, 
fall out of the bounds of rudimentary quantification. 

Below is the Game of Sliding Alliances on six constituents
with two entities.

**GSA:** A Game of Sliding Alliances. The "alliance" factor 
has already established connection and conducted activity 
with the first constituent of its interest, node $B$. The 
black box is the justification that $F$ will use, as a 
resource, for its justification functions $f_j^{B}$ (justification 
to node $B$ for shattering connection), $f_j^{J}$ (information/resources 
to build up the justification in a situational way), and 
$f_j^{F}$ (transfer of material to $F$ for it to execute functions 
that rely on $J$, $f_j^{B}$ and $f_a^{(2)}$. Functions $f_a^{(1)}$
and $f_a^{(2)}$ are functions used to establish connections to 
constituents of the "alliance" (all nodes except for $F$ and 
black box $J$). The self-loop from $F$ to itself is a meditative
function, allowing it to continually revise and review its strategy
and exhibited tactics by using new information/resources. 
The strategy of $F$ (not displayed in diagram) is to establish 
meaningful connections with the lead nodes of the two entities,
resulting in positive outcomes for them two. Then, by the 
desired well-meaning history of the two lead nodes with respect
to $F$, the other nodes will be more receptive and condoning 
to $F$'s activity. 

This section relies on the conceptualization of automata
as Conway's Game of Life, invented by British mathematician 
John Horton Conway, to aid with describing possible 
deltas in "alliances", as depicted by graphs. 

## Denying Sophistication <a name="p12"></a>

An almost universal envy is aimed towards those that have 
become sophisticated (many would say this trait is nurtured 
rather than inherited) and competent. These sophisticated 
and competent are complex to understand, their methodologies 
difficult for their friends and foes alike to understand, 
and their places in society probably unattainable by others 
through merit, since their existences supercede any rank 
declared in the formal hierarchy, static or mutable in its 
placements. Irreplaceable, brilliant, understanding, 
ambitious, admirable, honorable, a step below godliness 
these sophisticated and competent are. Some of their 
"friends" and "foes" whisper, amongst themselves, 
about how dangerous these competent and sophisticated folks 
are. The ones with more animalistic views nickname them "snakes", 
"eagles", amongst other high-ranking predatory creatures. 
Their bloodthirsty competitors think of them as a constant 
threat to their own well-being, even if they have never posed 
any physical harm to them. But as to their prestige and ranking 
in the eyes of societies' members that these bloodthirsty 
competitors lust praise from, said competitors probably feel 
they have big problems to solve. And these big problems revolve 
around these competent and sophisticated folks. The word 
"anti-elitism" is inaccurate to describe these competitors; 
there is no mention or explicit rule forbidding a bloodthirsty 
competitor from being, for example, an aristocrat or feudal 
head of a vassal army. 

Sophistication is a process, and the products yielded from 
this process are not necessarily in line with the descriptor
"elaborate". The word "elaborate", from a perspective, holds 
the meaning of something too broad and diverse for condensation 
that would preserve the identity of that something. For example, 
a person that conducts elaborate activity to woo another person 
of their romantic wants may, in actuality, not be very well-versed 
(the experienced as the sophisticated) in acts of wooing and seduction. 
The sophisticated are recognized as this label relative to their 
peers, peers that may fluctuate in identity over the course of different 
contexts. A person, recognized as sophisticated because they hold 
some unique ability to engineer proteins or to replicate DNA for 
cloning, may appear so to many people with other unique skills and 
talents, but amongst this person's peers such as their educators 
and workplace colleagues, they are quite unremarkable. In this 
case, it is the practice and products that this particular person 
engages in that is what is "actually sophisticated" from some 
people's recognition, not the actor that is the person. 

The term "sophisticated" is somewhat intertwined, by mainstream 
interpretation, with elitism or a trait possessed by elites. 
Replication, ever since human beings have learned to industrialize, 
plagues the uniqueness that many aspirants hold as a second 
objective during their stages of sophistication. Scarcity, 
as a simple economic concept, becomes a critical factor 
in valuation of sophisticated practices or products, even if 
public market pricing is not to occur from the start. These 
practices and products no longer produce the same kind of aura 
after undergoing distributive processes, such as democratization 
(no additional comment on this term), that produce replicants 
of that which was originally labeled "sophisticated". 

Sophistication does raise alarms from a defense perspective. 
This mentioned defense is not for those practices and products 
borne from sophistication. Rather, this defense is an antithetical 
stance towards sophistication, with great condemnation of its 
possible fruits that is the sophisticated. Popular questions include:
- "What is the need for this sophisticated product? How would I, 
  from this background X with skillset Y, make use of this 
  sophisticated product?"
- "What would happen to my welfare if this sophisticated 
  product were to intrude into my domain of work/life balance?"
- "How should I go about accepting or rejecting this sophisticated 
  product, since it clearly solves problems through its novelties, 
  yet the public perception of it is clouded by controversy?"
- "What are my long-term gains and losses by accepting this 
  sophisticated product into my daily life, in relation to 
  my peers that may or may not accept this product?" 

Sophistication, as a process in parallel to diversification 
and the decomposition of present-day mores and values, helps 
to spur changes in the form of "ripple"-like effects on 
activities and constructs spanning from the closely related 
(at the start of the ripple) to relations far removed by initial 
estimators. Hyper-specialization that is very frequently 
a trait of sophistication (although some that appear as sophisticated
may have a forgivably shallow understanding out of lack of 
effort) bears its effects in a radiating fashion. 
The source that is the sophisticated, through 
this distributive process of "ripple"-like effects, 
is then held, in some regards, as the "ideal", the "origin"
of all the changes attributed to this source. Security would
have to anticipate how "ideals" such as these are somewhat 
direct causes of the bending and supplanting of existing 
rules/attitudes belonging to greater society. From a 
conservation perspective, with related concepts being 
legacy, promotion of alien competition, and invitation 
for hypocrisy, these nu ideals can pave the way for 
destabilization if not wholly "adopted". 

Simple mechanisms for preserving the uniqueness of 
practices and products borne from sophistication processes 
include the well-known (maybe under different phrasing)
"hole for the sophisticated". This "hole for the sophisticated"
is a prime objective of strategies to contain the uniqueness
of the sophisticated from public knowledge, which would then be 
used to replicate the sophisticated. And the replication 
would definitely be a force of competition through 
ironically supplanting the sophisticated, in a cyclical 
turn-based adaptation pattern. The sophisticated are to 
remain in this hole due to rationalizations such as 
greater society's poor knowledge of the sophistication 
process and as importantly, the utility of the sophisticated. 
In contexts of scarcity, mass desires to utilize the 
sophisticated may backfire on the mass, as a collective, 
as each have to outcompete their fellow contenders on the 
path to its utilization. 

The defense perspective of sophistication now shifts to 
defending these processes under this label, and the 
practices/products from them. Some consequences that 
could be described as "weaknesses" from sophistication 
are exclusivity, higher rates of failure through a 
combination of less guidance and greater amounts of 
experimentation, and naturally less verification of 
methodology by peers fewer in numbers. And the sophisticated, 
when recognized, stands out in society in ways that garner
reactions such as nuisances (maybe even threats) in 
some way, shape, or form to their privacy. Important 
questions to ask are: how risky is the sophistication 
process, and how fragile is the sophisticated from this
process? The valuation, as numbers or descriptors supposed 
to be "objective", relies on calculations of the 
juxtaposition between the fragility (weaknesses) of 
the sophisticated and its effectiveness as a magnitude 
onto metrics that concern some objective/s. The 
beginning of this section mentions the "sophisticated 
and competent" as centers where envy is aimed at. 
The meaning of the word "competent", from a defense 
perspective, is the resilience against outside forces 
that do not approve of the sophistication/sophisticated 
in question. Can those that are undergoing sophistication 
stand up to the tried-and-true, those that may have 
nothing better to do than to challenge by interrupting 
their "transformations" or subverting their livelihood? 
If the answer is YES, then surely, the sophisticated 
and competent have something new to offer out of their
reliability and unique strengths brought forward against
those of the tried-and-true side. 

To adopt sophistication processes and proliferate the 
sophisticated is a trade-off decision problem, these 
problems being very frequent in economic decisions. 
In some cases, sophistication processes yield no 
improvements that can be objectively measured. They 
are simply trends, different lines of thinking and 
practicing and producing, that may turn out to be 
cause for contempt from others that view themselves 
as the origin and the sophisticated as the diversified 
"children" challengers. These preferences for the 
sophisticated may prove to be superior to their more 
frequent counterparts. And their more frequent counterparts 
may be used more oftentimes due to their lower risk 
of failure in executing some task. Some ending diagrams 
show how sophistication may fare alongside long-standing 
and conservative approaches.

![image info](./images/ds_four.PNG)

**DS1:** Two processes, a sophistication process denoted by $s_i$ 
nodes in a sequence, and a conservative (original) counterpart 
process denote by the $c_i$ nodes. 

![image info](./images/ds_one.PNG)

**DS2:** The conservative process attempts to disrupt the 
sophistication process by maliciously targeting node $s_2$. 

![image info](./images/ds_two.PNG)

**DS3:** The conservative process discards its original 
nodes $c_2,c_3$, and "adopts" partial steps from the 
sophistication process. 

![image info](./images/ds_three.PNG)

**DS4:** The conservative process attempts to take 
ownership over the proliferation stage of the sophistication 
process. The conservative process maintains its original 
components, and only intends to possess the product of 
the sophistication process. 

## The Sophisticated as Behavior After Appearance <a name="p13"></a>

With regards to inanimate objects that possess no 
autonomy to change appearance or expression to some 
third-party observer, the observer's judgment of the 
object as being sophisticated or not does not change 
due to the null actions of the object. The observer 
may change their judgment, presented in opinionated 
forms for this relativistic term called sophisticated,
on this object due to relinquishing their own mental 
artifacts, possibly incorporating "ideals" from 
outside of their centrality, that have prevented them 
from appreciating the object for "what it is". These 
mental artifacts, from a real-world human perspective, 
include cultural, ethnic, psychological, and institutional 
(nation, league, club, field) biases. The object may 
not be sophisticated according to its measurements 
on metrics, firmly established on a basis recognized 
as objective in ways more inarguable than not. But 
the observer could still perceive this object 
as sophisticated due to their underlying cognitive 
mechanisms in judging what is greater than the 
"base", the "average", the "ordinary". A similar 
possibility exists in the vice-versa case. The 
object may be sophisticated according to some metrics, 
but the observer does not recognize it as such by their 
judgement that rests on their own personal measurements 
along these established metrics. A subjectivity "issue". 
If the subjectivity is to be called out as an issue by 
opposition, those that maintain a united vantage point 
on the object that is or is not sophisticated, then the 
notion of the "sophisticated" falls out of empirical 
standardization by simple logical consistency. In 
some cases, those with differing views on the categorization 
of sophisticated on inanimate objects may be excluded 
from these objects' official judgment proceedings, 
in order to both deter escalation of conflict by 
preserving subjectivity and give the object a 
secure basis of "grace and dignity". The problem 
of labeling, as a computational task, becomes very 
complex in terms of transparency and agreement when 
applied onto "preferential ideals", including the 
sophisticated. 

Procedures to detect qualities with capabilities to 
appear and act in nuanced ways remain imperfect in a 
general context. One of these qualities is the effects 
of sophistication. These procedures may rely on a 
plausible sequence of detecting actions reliable 
enough (plausible through passing accuracy thresholds) 
so that changing of the sequence's components, in the 
advent of differing forms of sophistication, is not 
required. But each of the sequence's components may 
have to "calibrate" their characteristics to accomodate 
the differing form. Stark contrasts between procedures 
to measure any quality, including the sophisticated, 
may corrode the perception of some of these procedures' 
"accuracy". From a statistical perspective relying on 
frequency count, similar scores between contrasting 
procedures produce a stronger argument for these 
procedures' judgment outcomes. And differing scores 
encourage questioning on grounds of unwanted variability. 

Some that recognize an other as sophisticated at the 
start, for initial appearances do matter in the context 
of a span encompassing the "beginning", the "beginning" 
possibly playing an outsized influence in overall 
judgment, may arrive at their cognition's own future 
conclusion that this other is "really not" sophisticated. 
There was a deceptive veneer used by them to draw 
others towards them. And when some objective, including 
a lack of objective, is accomplished, they exposed 
qualities that run contrary to the observers' rubric 
of sophistication. This rubric typically draws 
associations from traits,poses, and actions to 
highly-valued ideals. These associations are supposed 
to be, by the observer's notion of integrity of judgment, 
"accurate" in determining the truthfulness of some 
label (the sophisticated in this case) in the process 
of transformative appearances, that which constitutes 
the behavior that can be objectively recorded. 

Before even considering some noun as sophisticated or 
not in their totality, as in their transformative 
appearances that constitute their behavior, consider 
the rubric to judge if an inanimate object is 
sophisticated or not as a non-linear connective 
process. The term "non-linear connective" is to 
describe judgments that do not entirely observe any 
single attribute as this or that label. Rather, the 
constituents of the object in question must somehow 
"match" together in arbitrarily-defined sets to form 
images consistent with some label. A term used to 
describe this way of judgmental processing is 
<ins>gestault</ins>. 

![image info](./images/tsba_one.PNG)

**TSBA1:** The analytic function used to judge if the 
object, consisting of the structure defined by green 
nodes and its edges, is sophisticated. Function $F_A$ 
takes as its input a rubric $R$. One of the pathways 
it takes to analyze the nodes $[s_0,s_1,s_3]$ is 
$R(s_0),R({s_1,s_0}),R({s_3,s_1,s_0})$. Note how 
the analytic function "builds" up its parameters 
at every new node it touches in this pathway. The 
rubric $R$ consists of rules to check the quality 
of every attribute $s_i$ alongside other attributes 
$s_j$ for quality, in and of themselves, and together 
for "systemic integrity". For example, attributes $s_0$,
$s_1$, and $s_2$ each pass quality tests. But for 
some reason, when they co-exist together in this 
particular object, there is a "mismatch" that reduces 
the overall score. The single judgment derived from 
function $F_A$ by rubric $R$, in this case, is that 
the object is not sophisticated. 

![image info](./images/tsba_two.PNG)

**TSBA2:** A similar object to the one in diagram TSBA1. 
There is a different rubric $R$ used, and two additional 
attributes exist (orange nodes). In this example, if the 
object does not have the orange nodes, it is classified 
by $F_A$ with rubric $R$ as sophisticated. But if the 
orange nodes are also included, then $F_A$ not only 
classifies it as not sophisticated, it also labels 
it as "elaborate" due to the extraneous features. 
The attributes depicted by the orange nodes do not 
add any functional strength or aesthetic draw to the 
object. And the rating of the object decreases with 
the inclusion of these additional attributes.

There are two broad cases of judging if an object 
is some particular label. Refer back to diagram TSBA1. 
Suppose the object in diagram TSBA1 is labeled by most 
operating agents of analytic function $F_A$ with rubric 
$R$ as sophisticated. But there are outliers that do not 
arrive at the same labeling. One category of these 
outliers uses the tactic of <ins>hyper-critical</ins> 
evaluation. These outliers rest their single judgment 
on low scores, scores that could be intentionally 
devalued by them, of certain attribute pathways 
in the function's application of the rubric. The 
other category is <ins>standard-markdown</ins>, 
a fancy term for inflating low values or ignoring 
those low values that are used in the judgment 
procedure. 

![image info](./images/tsba_three.png)
![image info](./images/tsba_four.png)

**TSBA3:** Two probability distributions belonging to 
two agents A and B. The probability values (on y-axis) 
of the two distributions are scores for the "easiness" 
of executing a decision (enumerated as a number on the 
x-axis). These possible decisions pertain to an arbitrary 
choice shared between the two agents. Examples of choices 
include executing the next strike in a physical combat,
the use of specific words in a language's vocabulary, 
and financial options for investment. In the first 
distribution, Agent A has the highest easiness in achieving
the move enumerated as $0.1$. In the second distribution, 
Agent B has the highest easiness in achieving move $5$. 

In distributions TSBA3, an observer cannot determine 
the "superiority" (higher quality, greater yield, etc.)
of any of the moves, enumerated on the x-axis, simply 
by their associated agents' easiness of execution (y-axis). 
Suppose, however, that the best move for Agent A to 
take, relative to agent B, is move $5$. But it has 
such a low probability of achieving it. And the best 
move for agent B to take is also move $5$. Agent B 
has a high probability of executing this move. Agent 
B and Agent A execute the moves $5$ and $0.1$, 
respectively, and Agent B comes out as the one that 
has won more than lost to Agent A. Ponder on the 
underlying causes for why Agent A could not execute 
its wanted move $5$ of its ideal choice. Could the 
answer be as simple as claiming that Agent A lacked 
the sophistication required of its composition
to be capable of executing move $5$? From a 
results-oriented perspective, Agent A has lost to Agent B. 
But perhaps the notion of Agent A's lack of "sophistication" 
as a sole determining factor in its loss is a stretch 
in empirical logic. Agent A and Agent B both have 
difficulty in achieving move $10$. Maybe the easiness 
of achieving move $10$ is what is actually the most 
accurate determinant in measuring how sophisticated 
an agent is. If move $10$ is truly a determinant in 
measuring sophistication, then both agents A and B 
are not sophisticated. Measuring an agent's level of 
sophistication by their performance on a gains-based 
criteria, such as in a structured competition, is not 
necessarily without fault; a strength, which may include 
fault in reasoning and practices stemming from it, is 
that doing so is relatively easy to accomplish by 
empirical observation. 

The sophisticated are typically put into a light of 
stylistic ideal, at least in the beginning after their 
births. Due to the scarcity of what is recognized as 
"sophisticated", there are naturally less opportunities 
to demonstrate the effectiveness of the sophisticated 
over the ordinary, given the condition that the ordinary 
remains as the mainstream preference in both thought and 
practice. And even if the sophisticated proves superior 
along select metrics to the ordinary, the sophisticated 
tend to be put into conditions that garner low proliferation 
rates, such as through the "hole for the sophisticated" 
that is mentioned in the previous section Denying 
Sophistication. 

| ~~ | Maintain | Work For Move 5 |
| --- | -------------- | -------- |
| Agent A | (20,-20) | (40,-400) |

**SOPHIMP1:** In this cost table, Agent A from distribution 
TSBA3 has the choice to maintain its composition, so that 
the probability values from TSBA3 graph one does not change. 
Or it can work for move 5 in ways that increase its level 
of easiness in executing the move. The pair-value of each
cost is: 
(cost of effort in decision, consequences of pursuing decision). 
Agent A may not be able to afford to work for move 5; 1 x 2. 

| ~~ | Execute Move 5 | Work For Move 10 |
| --- | -------------- | -------- |
| Agent B | (20,200) | (40,-400)|

**SOPHIMP2:** In this cost table, Agent A from distribution 
TSBA3 has the choice to continue executing move 5 against 
its competitor Agent B. Or it could stray away from actively 
focusing on playing against Agent B by working for move 10. 
The pair-value of each cost is equivalently defined to SOPHIMP2; 
1 x 2. 

In the two tables SOPHIMP1 and SOPHIMP2, both agents have 
a much greater likelihood of pursuing the first move (first column)
in their tables. The markedly greater consequences of each of 
them pursuing the second move is a major factor in their 
choosing to conserve their compositions. The two agents A 
and B may fall into a <ins>pragmatism trap</ins>. The 
trap allows them to steer away from negative consequences, 
projected by each of them to occur in the advent of their 
attempts to undergo sophistication for moves difficult by 
their execution, through pressuring them into conservative 
cycles of action. These conservative cycles of action rest on 
resources and capabilities already conveniently available 
to them. 

The section Denying Sophistication posits that there exists 
high envy aimed against the "sophisticated and competent". 
With only exactly one of these qualities fulfilled, there 
is not much of that same high envy received, so goes the 
posit. Intertwining the term "sophisticated" with those 
alluding to high-potential functionality, such as 
"competent", "effective", "powerful", "aggressive", 
and "prestigious" adds additionally explicit meaning 
around the usage of the term. The mentioned intertwined 
terms can be interpreted as related to the usage of 
the label "sophisticated", but without their explicit use 
alongside this label, there can only be implication that 
the correspondent terms are positively connected by 
some belief system, one with a probabilistic rate of 
accuracy. If brevity is the secondary aims of explaining 
this term "sophisticated", then its agreeable definitions 
make greater mention of the relation with ideals rather 
than with functionality. The notion of utility does play 
a real role of application in an ordered world, the order 
preserved and propagated through effective utility. So 
there is this rationale for delving into the term 
"sophisticated", due to what is labeled as such to 
potentially yield high contributions for practical 
advancement. 

As mentioned in this section and the last, there is at 
least some overlap in usage of the term "sophisticated" 
with "elaborate". Whatever lines differentiating these 
two terms, whether fine or bold, do make mention of the 
essential nature of those labeled "sophisticated" and 
the others "elaborate". The "elaborate" tend to lack an 
origin, as perceived by third-party inspectors. The 
"elaborate" do not need to rely on any novel techniques 
to exist in their forms, but do require a greater-than-average 
number of layerings to present themselves in outward 
appearance. One feature of the "elaborate", already 
mentioned, is that they would lose their identity 
if they are to undergo condensation. The possibly greater 
effectiveness of the "sophisticated" in comparison to 
the "elaborate" is that the authentically "sophisticated" 
do rest on principles simple and reliable, while the 
"elaborate" are so due to the lack of obligation in their 
resting on an origin that is principle. 

When products borne from sophistication do fail, it is 
due to the faults bred by the elaborate additions, 
additions that "hijack" control directly or through 
enablement of the principles simple and reliable bred 
through the sophistication process. It can be argued 
that the sophisticated do need to be competent, that 
the requirement of competency should automatically 
fall under those categorized as "sophisticated". And 
competency does require a high success rate in the 
control of principles simple and reliable, lest those 
principles be hijacked and re-engineered for purposes 
including subversion of the sophisticated, as well 
as repurposing the sophisticated against ideals 
and other nouns that it was intended to be aligned 
with, from its conception. 

Entertain the notion of the sophisticated as inherently 
competent. The mechanisms of the sophisticated cannot 
be so simply abstracted by a singular framework. 
There is a need to use rudimentary structures such 
as networks and frequency tables to explore the 
competence of the sophisticated, however. It has 
already been stated that the sophisticated possess 
properties of uniqueness, and these rudimentary structures 
cannot possibly include all the specificities of this 
uniqueness. But they can model the sophisticated's mechanisms 
and constituents as functions relative to one another. 
From the usual standpoints of adversary and ally in 
relation to the sophisticated, these structures could be 
sufficient enough, from a systematic perspective, towards 
understanding the operational and constitutional workings 
of the sophisticated. 

Assume the sophisticated to be a benign force, in the 
default case. They have no motive to initiate aggression 
against others, these others being sophisticated or not, 
in the form of exploitation and/or supplantation. This 
assumption may, of course, not be in line with real-life 
practices. No need for exemplification, but by the 
abstractions, DS1-DS4, provided in the previous section 
(Denying Sophistication), the sophisticated may believe 
it suitable to initiate confrontation with what they 
believe are threats to their lone existence and/or 
proliferation. This assumption is necessary, in this 
section, for the sake of brevity. If, for example, 
the sophisticated views another that sees the sophisticated 
as an adversary or ally opposite, then additional 
modeling rules need to be put in place; negative 
multiplication/addition rules serve as a good starting 
principle for these additional rules, but this added 
complexity requires extraneous explanation which the 
reader can independently construct. Important 
aspects to consider, in cases of the sophisticated that 
are not benign (in line with the other's alignment) 
from the start, are the underlying factors of this 
predisposition's causality, potentially much more 
complicated in calculation than the boolean rules 
of negative multiplication/addition. Recall the 
"hole for the sophisticated". This "hole" can be 
used as a mechanism for the initially belligerent 
sophisticated. The sophisticated would employ this 
"hole" for elaborate defenses against those they 
judged as adversaries, regardless of these others' 
views of them. 

The focus on the question of the sophisticated 
now shifts from singular appearance, perhaps due 
to its inanimate nature, to transformative 
appearances that constitute the behavior of the 
object in question. From either an adversarial 
or allied standpoint, the first step towards approaching 
the benign sophisticated is to "discover" their 
constituents. This "discovery" process resembles 
the novel elements perceived during a sort of 
magnification, in other words, redirectional and 
intensifying focus. 

![image info](./images/disc_one.PNG)
![image info](./images/disc_two.PNG)
![image info](./images/disc_three.PNG)

**DISC1:** Stages of a "discovery" process onto 
sophisticated object $S$ (first image). In the 
second image, the process yields the finding that 
$S$ is made up of two disjoint components $S_0$ 
and $S_1$. In the last stage displayed, these 
two components yield a four-node graph and 
three-node graph. 

Observe the sophisticated object $S$ from diagram 
DISC1. Agent A, adversary to $S$, with $S$ being 
aware of this alignment, discovers that $S$ is, 
by structural composition, something like the 
third image of diagram DISC1. Agent A proceeds 
to attack $S$ using the data displayed in the 
table below.  

![image info](./images/tsba_tab1.PNG)

**TSBAT1:** Information for adversarial Agent A 
to conduct attacks against the purportedly 
sophisticated $S$. The information does not have 
a guarantee of accuracy, for one. Another important 
detail about the information is that the information 
about the effects of each of Agent A's moves against 
the nodesets is incomplete; 6 x 3. 

Certain ways exist for the sophisticated $S$ to 
exhibit to the attacking Agent A that they are, in 
fact, sophisticated, that they are, in fact, 
sophisticated in not only appearance in such manners 
that they rapidly deteriorate under the pressure 
of choice-attacks by Agent A. These ways are 
counteracting mechanisms, listed in generality 
below: 
1. The information on the effects by action of 
  Agent A on S is inaccurate. 
  - The values are simply wrong. 
  - Expected effects from Agent A's attacks may not 
    bear long-lasting relevance. For example, Agent 
    A would have to choose moves that result in the 
    constituent becoming exactly a null existence, 
    instead of a "negative" existence. A "negative" 
    existence of a constituent could, in turn, lead 
    to respawning of the constituent back into its 
    "positive" form, or to generate new constituents 
    previously non-existing in the realm of Agent A's 
    knowledge. These outcomes do reason to be arbitrary, 
    but that would be because they rest on the 
    arbitrarily-defined protocol of S not known to 
    Agent A through to that specific point in time (the 
    instance after attacking). 
2. There exists additional effects stemming from 
   each possible move by Agent A. These additional 
   effects present themselves as <ins>hidden layers</ins> 
   of information not readily available, by analytical 
   and intrusive capabilities belonging to Agent A. 
   Hidden layers could yield additional effects from 
   the execution of a move by Agent A: 
  - Opposite changes that can be nullifying or 
    polarizing to the effect expected by Agent A, 
    based on the information it has. 
  - Sub-constituents are yielded from the constituents 
    (nodes) affected by Agent A's executed move, 
    modifying Agent A's knowledge of S's structural 
    composition. 
  - Affected nodes of Agent A's executed move modify 
    S' surface of vulnerability to attack. Possible 
    routes for S to modify include applying changes 
    onto each of the constituent's strengths and 
    weaknesses, and changing connectivity.   

Agent A could undergo improvements to its knowledge 
base of the sophisticated in tandem with that of its 
moveset through the iteration of trial-and-error 
procedures onto the sophisticated S. But the sophisticated 
S, in a competent form, would not allow this progress 
of Agent A to pass by to disturb its balance. The 
sophisticated S also "evolves" its structural composition 
and operational mechanisms in tandem, so that Agent A's 
improvements would be at least matched by their "evolution" 
if not outright overpowered. Also note that in 
this elaboration of adversarial Agent A against the 
sophisticated S, Agent A does not "discover" the 
structural composition of S in one span of activity. 
Instead, it probably has to continually "rediscover" 
what S is, through trial-and-error procedures. An 
important note, on the endurance of S against 
the onslaught of Agent A's offense, is that S could 
be "destroyed" in a way that Agent A would not 
judge S, by some of its updated appearances, to 
be sophisticated by its standard. Yet, if the 
requirement of competence to endure is set in place, 
then the only way for Agent A to demonstrate that 
S is not sophisticated is by its "defeating" of S. 
In such advents, Agent A would probably label S 
as an "elaborate" adversary without the firmness 
of control over the origin of its operational 
defense, per se. 

From the standpoint of an ally to the sophisticated, 
there would be actions designed and taken by 
the ally to be positively connected or integrated 
to the sophisticated, whatever that may entail. 

The sophisticated are extremely difficult to 
replicate, as already posited. This does imply 
that they cannot be systematically dissected with 
ease for total third-party comprehension. Attempting 
to do so could led to the destruction of the 
sophisticated, such destruction leaving little 
traces for comprehending the existence of previous. 
Circular reasoning by third-party agents, 
especially adversaries, reasoning by the same 
incorrect methodologies in iterative fashion to 
no avail, is a frequent occurrence. And this 
circular reasoning is due to the limited scope 
of comprehension available to the agent, in 
which full comprehension of the sophisticated 
is understanding in ways that allow for it to 
be replicated and additionally improved. The 
available structuralizations belonging to 
third-party observers fail to produce accurate 
and meaningful relations to the sophisticated, 
in the exactitude desired for comprehension. 
There are paradoxies at work in this general 
context. The third-party agent, assumed to 
rely on relatively conservative (in relation 
to the sophisticated) tools, cannot comprehend 
the sophisticated without also imitating their 
structural and operational details. And the 
sophisticated, by their condition of scarcity 
and feature of competence, cannot be improved, 
but only elaborated on by attachment of extraneous 
features. The sophisticated do defy the faulty 
rationales that imitators, with half-knowledges 
of their ideal to imitate, fall prey to in their 
quest to imitate the sophisticated. The claim 
that the sophisticated have control over their 
origin (the core, the source, etc.) produces 
an expectation: the sophisticated have a 
greater likelihood of autonomy, stemming from 
its own design, in comparison to the elaborate 
but unsophisticated.  

One last note on the distinction between the 
"elaborate" and the "sophisticated", without 
the ambiguity of overlap in gray-zone cases, 
is that the "elaborate", if weak, are weak by 
the <ins>symbolic inconsistency</ins> associated 
with them. These symbolic inconsistencies play 
a notable role in outsizing misinterpretation 
in execution (behavior).

**INCON:** A function $F$ with five different 
variants, of a roughly equivalent identity. 
The five variants are constituents of the 
elaborated and operated by it, depicted as 
node $S_0$.  

Suppose the wanted function is $F^{(1)}$, for 
application towards some problem faced by 
the elaborate. What are the chances for the 
elaborate, out of its timely necessity and 
convenience, to precisely choose this variant 
instead of the other four roughly equivalent? 
In this example, there are two differentiating 
functions, $diff_1$ and $diff_2$. These differentiating 
functions are to determine the qualities differing 
between any two of the five variant functions in 
diagram INCON. The differentiating functions, similar 
to the standard arithmetic difference function, 
is non-commutative. 

![image info](./images/tsba_tab2.PNG)

![image info](./images/tsba_tab3.PNG)

**TSBAT2:** The first table lists the outcomes from 
application of $diff_1$. The second table lists 
the accuracy and hardness (greater is harder) of 
using $diff_1$ for each pair; 5 x 5. 

![image info](./images/tsba_tab4.PNG)

![image info](./images/tsba_tab5.PNG)

**TSBAT3:** The first table lists the outcomes from 
application of $diff_2$. The second table lists 
the accuracy and hardness (greater is harder) of 
using $diff_2$ for each pair; 5 x 5. 

The resources available to the elaborate determine 
what function they choose as the differentiator 
for some wanted variant function $F^{(?)}$. For 
the case of $F^{(1)}$, the use of $diff_1$ 
requires less resources but it is less accurate, 
prone to outputting the wrong non-equivalent 
variant of $F^{(1)}$. Possible chain-reactions 
from incorrect utility of variants by the 
elaborate include the maximizing of chances 
for harm incurred onto the elaborate. Sources 
of the harm include external forces, as well as 
internal forces such as magnetic-like tension 
between the different similars that are the 
function variants. 

One last interesting point to put forward 
is that the sophisticated are not necessarily 
also revered, and do become vilified/villainized 
in specific contexts. There are arguments for the 
validity in this point from the aspects discussed 
in this section and the previous (Denying Sophistication). 

## Shifty and Shifting Alliances Pt. II <a name="p14"></a>

The topic of alliances is expansive. Causality and 
procedures pertaining to this topic have clearly not 
been touched in all, let alone in full, in the section 
Shifty and Shifting Alliances. Going so far as to 
attempt to explain the core causalities and procedures 
of alliances is also not sufficient in explaining the 
large leaps between the principle (causality and 
procedure) and application in the typical context 
of the real-world. This is a little disheartening to 
write. If causality's core can be explained, alongside 
with full detailing of procedures, then application should 
naturally have reasoning already known by this 
knowledge of causality, and the application would 
follow the frameworks set by the procedures. 
Application of principles, with regards to alliances, 
by sentient beings that may operate on non-deterministic, 
such as anti-deterministic, pseudo-stochastic, bases 
cannot be expected to understand any explanation 
of the core of causality, or to follow procedures 
for the correct contexts that is in accordance with 
prescribed extents (if they even exist). Alliances 
are a striving of many due to their promise of 
satisfying utilitarian needs, goals that could not 
be achieved otherwise without the necessity of a form 
of pragmatism, this form of pragmatism reliant on 
connectivity, that is, selective ignorance alongside 
choice initiatives for reliability in alignment. The 
discussion on alliances can very quickly shift to 
real-world applications, especially on the matters of 
diplomacy (localized, globalized, et cetera) and 
socio-economic constructs. Areas of focus for these 
applications, including but not limited to 
interpretability, capability, and compliability then 
fall under the prefix of "multi", a prefix with a 
default assumption of yielding probabilistic results 
stemming from universally agreed-upon "rules". This 
section is a continuation of the first part, and there 
is not a standout attempt to explore real-world 
representation by historical mentioning/rationale of 
specifics. 

In Shifty and Shifting Alliances, two graphical units 
were put forth (diagrams SA1 and SA2), but only one of 
them, the hierarchical unit of SA2, was used to illustrate 
"alliances" affected by outside forces, deemed "alliance" 
factors. Each alliance is depicted as a cumulative product 
of hierarchical units. The mesh structure of diagram MESH1 
has the feature of shared nodes between the hierarchical 
units and, as previously mentioned, there requires "toss-up" 
procedures to determine lead nodes in the structure, the 
alliance. Past the open-ended specificities of these "toss-up" 
procedures, one prime observance was on the connectivity of 
the structure after one of its constituents connected to 
the "alliance" factor. Certain connections, arbitrary from 
an unknowledgeable observer's point of view, shattered due 
to the involvement of the connected "alliance" factor. The 
specific reason why such events occurred is left to the 
reader's speculation, for connectivity between autonomous 
agents (assumed to be) is based on rules recognized as 
arbitrarily-defined. The principle, however, without 
detailing the reason for this principle, is that the 
"alliance" factor can alter the internal workings of 
an "alliance" after the "alliance" establishes contact 
with it. The illustration gives the impression to the 
reader that the "alliance" factor is similar to kinetic 
factors that result in changes onto surfaces they impact, 
so there is possibly that metaphorical misconception 
in interpreting it. Another prime observance was on how 
connecting to an "alliance" factor could change the 
hierarchical relations between the constituents. A 
lead node could be demoted to a sub-ordinate; a 
sub-ordinate could take the role of the lead. These 
two observances are fundamental enough to comprehend, 
but do serve as possibly complex courses of activity in 
alliances of a non-static organization. The section only 
considered single connections to an "alliance" factor. 
Without rigidly-defined rules for effects of an "alliance" 
connecting to an "alliance" factor, single connections 
sufficed in showing possible structural and hierarchical 
effects. 

One benefit of exploring alliances, capable of 
anti-conserving internal activity, with the scant 
starting framework of networks, called graphs in 
the lexicon of mathematics, is that their beginning 
shallowness can be extended into more and more 
nuances, implemented in a layered (stacked) 
priority-based structure. The layering can generate 
exponentially more outcomes, these greater number 
and variety of outcomes to satisfy realistic 
probability distributions. The layering can also 
be fitted and calibrated to satisfy narrow spaces 
of possibilities. Countless mathematical proofs have 
been written to demonstrate that the structure that 
is a graph has these capabilities stated. 

Suppose an "alliance" rests on a connection of expectations 
with an "alliance" factor. And this expected connection 
is actually many edges (connections) between constituents 
(plural) of the "alliance" with the "alliance" factor. 
This next example does not use the hierarchical unit of 
diagram SA2 due to the complication presented by their 
greater number of nodes to SA1. 

![image info](./images/ssa2_one.PNG)

**MCAF1:** Multi-connected "alliance" factor $F$ to the 
"alliance", the network of red nodes, each node a 
non-hierarchical unit.  

The "alliance" factor $F$, in multi-connected 
cases, is capable of some non-negative number $n$ 
of tasks. In diagram MCAF1, let this number be 
$5$. There are three units the "alliance" factor 
$F$ is connected to. How should $F$ work for 
these three units, $\{S_0,S_3,S_4\}$, given these 
5 tasks at its disposal? To first answer this 
specific question, the tables below provide 
preliminary but vital information on the specifics 
of these starting numbers. 

![image info](./images/ssa2_tab1.PNG)

**TASK1:** Table detailing the expendable amount of 
value for each of the five tasks capable by "alliance" 
factor $F$; 5 x 2.  

![image info](./images/ssa2_tab2.PNG)

**DEM1:** Table detailing the demand of each task's 
value per connected unit of the alliance to "alliance" 
factor $F$; 3 x 5. 

As this example is turning out, the "alliance" factor 
does not have enough value in any of its tasks, save 
for $T_4$, to serve all demands of the three "alliance" 
units it is connected to. There is the basic guideline 
in this connective arrangement that the supply should 
meet the demand, the supply being the (task,value) pairs 
belonging to the "alliance" factor and the demand the 
(task,value) pairs belonging to each of the connected 
"alliance" units. How can this problem of serving all 
interests be resolved without having to modify some 
of these numbers? The answer is that the problem cannot 
be. This example is vital to demonstrating why the 
notion of an "alliance" factor simply cannot serve 
as a completely reliable source of demand to any 
arbitrary network, such as this alliance. They, 
the alliance, must find ways to resolve this conflict 
of interest, for lack of a better phrase. There are 
some options outside of, say, the "alliance" factor 
inflating its tasks' values to fit the numbers in 
table DEM1. Value inflation may not work, after all, 
if the connected units accurately verify, by their 
own metrological inspection, the supply they have 
received.

Each of the connected units can attempt to "pacify" 
the expected demands of some other connected unit/s. 
This does read to be a sort of multi-feedback loop 
where one asks (demands?) another to accept a lower 
quantity of what the other claims to need. "Pacification" 
involves such schemes of a unit's partial or full 
prohibition of another's demanded value, forms of 
declaring the other to cease and desist, and/or 
persuasion of another, designed to appear as "friendly 
redirection", to strive for other alternatives. 
"Friendly redirection" of a unit with an unsatisfied 
demand could mean for that unit to be open to or 
seek new "alliance" factors that could at least 
fully compensate the deficits of their initial demands. 
If fairness for the connected units, in this context, 
is to accept the maximum threshold value of each of 
the demanded tasks belong to "alliance" factor $F$, 
and also for each of the units to reduce their 
demand in "some proportional way" to shave off the 
excess of their original cumulative demands, the 
issue would be resolved for this simple case of 
clean, singular values pertaining to the supply 
in question.

Despite each of the units of the alliance in 
diagram MCAF1 being one of a non-hierarchical 
type, the magnitude of their demands per task (see 
table DEM1) do play a role in their rankings, 
ordinal values signifying their prioritization 
as candidates in the demand line, amongst themselves. 
The unit $S_0$ has the greatest demand across all 
tasks of $F$, followed by $S_3$, then $S_4$. But 
without further information on each of these units, 
there can be no safe assumption on how they would 
rank each other as rewardees of the supply from $F$. 
An arrangement of ranking, between the candidate units 
for their wanted values, is required to resolve the 
question posed two paragraphs back. The ranking 
would constitute a form of hierarchy that qualitatively 
transforms the units of the alliance, similar to the 
qualities of the hierarchical unit, even though the 
units are of a non-hierarchical category, not granted 
the natural predisposition of constituents in an 
arrangement by assignment, as in the three-node 
hierarchical unit. 

The mentioned concepts of <ins>prohibition</ins> and 
<ins>friendly redirection</ins>, as pathways for resolving 
supply-demand incongruencies, are next touched in 
illustration. The other mention of <ins>proportion-based 
adjustments</ins> is left to adherents' independent 
calculations off of this approach. Prohibition, by 
practice, takes the form of rules. For organized 
efficiency, these rules are structured into indexed 
formats such as tables. In this work's formulation of 
alliances, prohibition could take the form of pre-meditated 
reactive chains in anticipation of some unit/s violating 
some stipulation/s set by other unit/s. These reactive 
chains could be designed at some point in their relevant 
existences (before or during the need to execute) to 
self-modify during realtime (on the go) execution. 

Prohibition rules are first put into a light of generality 
in this next table (PROHIB1). The category of "prohibition" 
for these rules is to mean them to be restrictions of 
flow (products, communications, et cetera) declared by 
one unit onto another. It is a funny term if oxymorons 
are to be thought of as funny, but the phrasing does 
serve a purpose in this section, and more importantly, 
in applications outside of this text. Oxymorons serve as 
confusing terms, this confusion caused by the understanding 
of opposite-ness between two "halves" of the terms that 
when combined, result in a lack of directed clarity. 
Rest assured, prohibition rules as a concept in this 
section are to be described with aims for full comprehension. 

A prohibition rule is a condition by one 
constituent to another constituent of an "alliance", 
to be adhered to in regards to the allocating of resources 
(values of tasks) that originally belongs to the outsider 
"alliance" factor. Each condition pertains to exactly 
one task of the "alliance" factor. Rules do come in various forms. 
Some rules are circular, others bear strictness by 
practice beyond their phrasing, and yet still, others 
have hierarchical exceptions attached to their enforcement. 
Constructs discussed in this section, operating on the 
sparse definition of a prohibition rule previously 
stated, place the requirement that each "alliance" unit 
must abide by the prohibition rules of others placed 
on them. But the requirement could be broken to result 
in outcomes not ordinary to the conservation of the 
"alliance". 

When hard numbers are the subject of decisions in 
prohibition rules, a type of condition called a 
<ins>threshold condition</ins> is used. A threshold 
condition is essentially one or more numerical ranges 
that pertaining numbers must fall in, in order for 
the satisfaction of that condition. Two classifications 
for prohibition rule conditions exist for thresholds, 
hard and relativistic. Hard thresholds are constant 
in nature, due to their attachment with non-changing 
quantities. On the other hand, relativistic thresholds 
are each associated with values that are compared 
with the input values in question. Here are a few 
samples of threshold conditions. 
- Input $x$ must fall in the range $[0,100)$; hard threshold. 
- Input $x$ must be at most half in value to $y$; relativistic threshold. 
- Input $x$ must be at most 3 more in value to $y$; relativistic threshold. 

![image info](./images/ssa2_tab3.PNG)

**PROHIB1:** Table detailing the prohibition rules declared 
by each of the units connected to "alliance" factor $F$ 
(see diagram MCAF1), with respect to $F$'s task $T_3$. 
Refer to the table DEM1 for the specific starting 
demand values of connected units for $T_3$. The row-wise 
(first column) units show the source of the rule and 
column-wise (first row) units show the subject of the 
rule. The rules of $S_0$ and $S_3$ onto $S_4$ are 
relativistic thresholds, and the remaining rules are 
hard thresholds.

A probable problem with prohibition rules as a 
square table, with no essential guidelines for their 
conditions, is that there can exist contradicting rules 
between the pertaining units of the "alliance". There 
is then the necessity of a "toss-up" procedure that 
determines what settlement is borne from these 
prohibition rules sitting on top of internal contradiction. 
For a set of $k$ connected units to an "alliance" 
factor $F$, there is a task $T_{?}$ of interest and 
a unit $u$ that is faced with contradictions on the 
prohibition rules placed on its demand of $T_{?}$. 
The $k-1$ other units assert these rules onto $u$. 
And for the possible range of values for $v$ that 
$u$ can choose from, every one of these values 
violate every prohibition rule set by the remaining 
$k-1$ units. Already, there is a problem that is this 
unsatisfiable decision problem. A "toss-up" procedure 
should resolve this contradiction of rule internal 
to the "alliance". Perhaps this "toss-up" procedure 
produces little to no negative change onto the alliance's 
unity. Here is another example. Using the same variable 
notation, there result two subsets $U_v$ and $U_s$ 
of the $k-1$ units. Unit $u$, with its demand value 
$v$ of $T_{?}$, violates the rules of subset $U_v$, 
and satisfies the rules of subset $U_s$. Once again, 
a sort of "toss-up" procedure is called for to resolve 
the violations of the rules wanted satisfied by 
$U_v$. This is different from the first example, in 
which every unit besides from $u$ had its prohibition 
rule violated. In this example, there is a dichotomy 
between those rule-satisfied and those not. What 
difference of the outcome, that is, of unit $u$ 
adjusting its demand value $v$ for task $T_?$, 
does this difference in rule-satisfaction make? 

What are some questions that should be asked here? 
Think. Ponder on this, please. What kind of alliance 
would form only to issue rules contradictory to 
each other? Or... what kind of alliance could not 
resolve rules they themselves put forth? And ... 
how much jeopardy do alliances fall prey to 
in their quest to establish uniformly accepted 
rules for failure? For success? 

There are fluxes in the "balance". The "balance" 
needs to be set to something better, a re-solution 
for the solution that no longer works. Here is an 
expression that works as a template for finding 
this re-solution. 

![image info](./images/ssa2_formula.PNG)

In this expression, the function $G^{config_A}$ is 
based on the configuration of the alliance $A$ at some 
point in its existence, and a specific task $T_{?}$. 
It takes as input the "alliance" factor $F$, a unit 
$u$ belonging to $A$, the set of units $U_v$ with 
prohibition rules violated by the expected demand of 
$u$, and the set of units $U_s$ with prohibition rules 
satisfied by $u$. The function outputs specific changes 
for each unit's prohibition rule on task $T_{?}$. These 
changes are applied onto each of the units. Another 
set of changes by $q(u_i)$, taken to mean the qualities 
and quantities of the unit $u_i$ outside of prohibition 
rules but still subject to change due to the adjustments 
in the prohibition rules, is also applied onto the units. 
Expression $G^{?}_{?}$ is a corrective mechanism, 
left open-ended on the question of what $\Delta$ is with 
regards to prohibition rules and qualities/quantities 
belonging to each member of the alliance. Some terms 
of categorical nature can be used to speculate on what 
$\Delta$ is. Changing behavior and expectations 
(prohibition rules, in this context) between members 
of a group, such as an alliance, are <ins>comparative-corrective 
processes</ins>, maybe <ins>forced-learning processes</ins> 
in cases where there is a disproportionate amount of 
dissatisfaction from one or more of the units involved, 
so much that there are hidden desires if not explicit 
calls for separation from the group. Notice how the 
term "group" was used very synonymously with the 
word "alliance". The interchangeability between these 
terms is to express how "alliances" with great 
fluxes in their unity could safely be called "groups" 
instead. 

![image info](./images/ssa2_two.PNG)

**MCAF2:** A multi-connected "alliance" factor $F$ 
that is insufficient in supplying the wanted values 
of its capable tasks to an alliance. Two of the 
connected units to $F$ decide to seek out a new 
"alliance" factor $F_2$ to fill the deficit. The 
question of the connections between the alliance 
and $F$ is put up for question. This is a case of 
<ins>friendly redirection</ins> of the alliance 
from $F$ to another "alliance" factor that could 
possibly replace $F$ as the supplier. 

The changes in connectivity between units of 
the alliance are not illustrated in this image, 
although edges (connections) between the alliance 
units could be shattered. A kind of hierarchical dynamic 
between the units $S_0$, $S_3$, and $S_4$ in 
pursuit after their demands also seems to present 
itself as a suspected cause of the friendly redirection 
to the new "alliance" factor $F_2$. 

Weakly-connected alliances do not reason to be conducive 
to activity that requires the opposite of "weak 
connections". At least that much can be stated on 
the labeling of a connection as "strong" or "weak". 
The cliched reasoning is that it is not always the 
label, but the utility and outcomes envisioned by 
the user/s of the labeling that determine the power 
by achievement of some mark. In this section's showing 
of a multi-connected "alliance" factor, metrics of 
weakly-connected alliances can be gathered from a 
few of their operational attributes. Alliances with 
high degrees of measurable contradiction in their 
prohibition rules, amongst themselves, are weakly-connected 
due to the necessity for "toss-up" procedures as 
resolution intended to reduce the contradiction. 
These "toss-up" procedures could result in shattering 
of connections in the alliance, as well as changing 
relations of hierarchical nature between the units. 
Instability by lack of <ins>state conservation</ins>, 
in the form of changing alliance configurations, can be 
considered connectivity that is weakly-connected. Friendly 
redirection of demand from alliance units to more and more 
"alliance" factors also contains indicators of the 
strength of connection shared between the alliance's 
units. Many other points on connectivity strength can 
be conjectured, with the lack of certainty by lack of 
given underlying details, on how the lack of state 
conservation is a variable impactful by its broadness 
and depth into the workings of the constituents of an 
alliance. There is the perspective that if change can 
be adjusted to a constant level for "constant change", 
the "constant change" satisfies the definition of 
state conservation, but that is a matter 
that does not fall completely under the umbrella of 
this section. The semantics of conservation in supply-demand 
flows, authoritative chains of decision-making (hierarchical 
practices in great acceptance), and ideal references for 
correctness, when observed from their beginnings to 
outcomes "believed to be caused by them", do not exactly 
fit universal guidelines of state conservation; 
some would additionally argue that establishing universal 
guidelines for state conservation is antithetical to 
the longevity of their practitioners. 

A weighted solution that encompasses all three of these 
pathways (prohibition, friendly redirection, proportion-based 
adjustments), meaning a procedure that assigns scales of 
influence with typical significations to proportion, 
is a viable option. Weighting schemes generate a 
greater if not equal number of solutions, due to their 
ability of assigning 0 influence or arbitrarily 
positive/negative influence to each variable (pathway). 
It is just that these schemes' essential principle is 
achieving correctness, by a reference that is deemed 
correct, via the calibration of the "weights" of 
influence connecting to each of the "cores" (pathways). 
If the pathways are not explicitly mentioned and 
reviewed for their relevance in qualities of relations 
and derivatives, then the weighting scheme can not 
be ensured to be a solution on stable grounds. This 
does read to be tasks for quantitative computationists. 

## The Great-Wind's Restriction <a name="p15"></a>

A vector for the medium. What can come out of this 
vector, of wind harmless, is it, that is borne from what 
benign medium, empty and still if not for what children, 
its vectors of directed heir? There can be no difference 
then, supposedly, between a Great-Wind and a No-Wind. 
The medium that is harmless should output vectors also 
of that category. The magnitude truly of no matter, 
except for those of the condition to be impacted by it. 
A rationale on why this container, the medium, for possibilities 
not fully mentioned in sufficient definition is essentially 
harmless. But the proof of its harmlessness, from source 
that is input to its outputs by a particular basis able 
to transform into other bases, potentially yielding other 
outputs, is not found in this paragraph. 

The Great-Wind's Restriction is a phenomenon of nature 
that is waged against at least one or more autonomous 
agents. The agents are autonomous because they do not 
have to act according to the will of the Great-Wind. 
Alternatively, an agent that acts in accordance with 
the will of the Great-Wind grants them benign treatment 
from the Great-Wind. The Great-Wind's Restriction is 
not harmless to these agents since it seeks to negatively 
affect the agents' autonomy, through force of derailment 
and resistance, and possibly as well as their existence. A 
lot of documents,media, and other truthful illustrations 
of nature have been produced. But for this session, 
assume nature to mean the forces outside of the control 
of the autonomous agents. Funnily, from the perspective 
of the Great-Wind, it is these autonomous agents that 
would be nature because it goes against its autonomy. 
As clarity in alignment, though, the Great-Wind is 
nature. A transcendental perspective of nature is that 
nature is what remains of what forces outside of the 
control of the central autonomous forces that have a 
non-zero probability of modifying the extent of its 
control. In this case, it would be the autonomous agents 
in the midst of the Great-Wind's Restriction. What 
these autonomous forces can control by their natural 
predisposition is not nature. In these statements made, 
there is implication of the nature VS nurture argument, 
another favorite by dichotomists seeking to differentiate 
between those leaning towards one end or the other of 
this argument and also those down the center lane. 

The Great-Wind's Restriction is a reactionary force of 
antagonism waged by the Great-Wind against agents with 
autonomous capabilities, of its disliking. Regardless 
of superstitious beliefs and issues of interpretability 
regarding this section's description of the Great-Wind 
thus far, at least the point in the previous sentence 
is made clear enough. The Great-Wind is not exactly like 
a boa constrictor. It is an intangible lack of emptiness 
with its restriction. And it raises its demands every 
time its expectations, of demands imposed onto those 
of its disliking, are satisfied. For the disliking and 
the Great-Wind, one of them has to go.

**GWR1:** Depiction of five autonomous agents. The 
agents are in a confined space advantageous to their 
guarding against outsider threats. 

![image info](./images/gwr_two.PNG)

**GWR2:** The same five autonomous agents from diagram 
GWR1. The green arrows emitting from each agent represent 
the agent's capabilities or assets, and should not be interpreted 
as only wanted navigational directions of travel. For example, 
a green arrow could represent an energy-recycling mechanism, 
auxiliary tools for communication, or next calculated steps 
in an arbitrary procedure. The blue connections shared between 
the agent show coordination/cooperation/corrobation of sorts.

Observe the diagrams GWR1 and GWR2, and their corresponding 
descriptions. The Great-Wind has decided to strongly dislike 
this group of autonomous agents. It initiates an attack in 
cycled stages against them. The stages are such: 
- the smart-boa's constriction, 
- the shadow's expansion, 
- the observerless strike. 

Although the last stage is the most impressive by the 
physically destructive impact to the agents, potentially 
past the point of their termination, the stage does come 
last. 

The smart-boa's constriction consists of actions by the 
Great-Wind in its mimicking of the boa's predatory 
patterns and scaling up power according to its rightful 
resources after this mimicry. There are two primary 
labels for moves used in this stage: 
- <ins>onion-based force</ins>,  
- <ins>reactive-chain improvements</ins>. 
  
In this stage, the objective of the Great-Wind is to 
incapacitate the capabilities of each of the agents, 
to restrict utility of their assets if not outright 
seize them. The Great-Wind intends to ensure that 
there is no longer viable probability in the agents 
each satisfying their objectives. During this process, 
the agents may find themselves to experience technical 
difficulties in meeting the marks for their objectives. 
They would expectedly shift their focus from their 
objectives, established before the starting instance 
of encounter with the Great-Wind, to escaping from or 
nullifying the influence of the smart-boa's constriction. 

The onion-based force emits at each of the autonomous 
agents. This force consists of a sequence of onion-like 
pulses, each with self-modifying properties. Each of 
the pulses have a labyrinthian formation to them, designed 
to maximize the plight of confusing counteraction against 
the target agent. 

![image info](./images/gwr_three.PNG)

**GWR3:** An onion-based pulse approaching an undrawn 
target from the left. 

The multiple layers of a typical onion-based pulse 
are intended to detach the intended target of their  
assets by the vicious gaps between every layer of 
the pulse. The Great-Wind would expect, with a 
non-zero probability, that the assets would come 
out of the onion-based pulse from the other direction 
that the pulse emits at. The Great-Wind also expects 
this onion-based pulse to lock the target into 
awkward and expensive positions in such ways that 
they would not be able to execute their capabilities 
at their will. 

The layers of the onion-based pulse could very 
possibly be undone, solved in other words, in the 
manner of one that escapes a labyrinth. The pulse 
is not designed to be entirely destructive against 
its target. The agent against the pulse could be 
torn up past the threshold to be labeled destroyed, 
but that would be due to the Great-Wind's overestimation
of them. This first stage of the attack, called the 
smart-boa's constriction, is given the name because 
the Great-Wind has placed the stage as one to induce 
weakness into the agents of its disliking. The Great-Wind 
does this because it conjectured that the agents would 
not be fallen if it were to skip this stage and rush 
into the second and third stages. 

So the onion-based pulse may fail in its objectives, 
to negate the agent's assets and capabilities from 
themself. Below are decision tables showing the choices 
belonging to an agent encountering an onion-based pulse 
that is impacting them.

![image info](./images/gwr_tab1.PNG)

**GWRT1:** Table showing the counter-actions the 
Great-Wind's onion-based pulse $W$ can take, during the 
stage of the smart-boa's constriction, for each of the 
moves of Agent $A$. The indices $(i,j)$ with $0$ values 
indicate the $i$'th move of $W$ cannot counter-act the 
$j$'th move of $A$. For the other values, they are 
non-null and arbitrarily-defined. 

![image info](./images/gwr_tab2.PNG)

**GWRT2:** Corresponding table for the above (GWRT1). 
Each non-zero element is a triplet of $(inversion,reversion,base)$. 

In table GWRT2, the base value is the default gain and 
loss from the smart-boa's constriction's move. The reversion 
is the negation of the agent's corresponding move, the 
action to the constriction's counteraction. And the 
inversion is the "flipping" of the agent's move's 
force into the realm of usage for the Great-Wind. 
The inversion value cannot be greater in absolute 
value than the input, the agent's move's force. The 
Great-Wind could immediately apply the force from 
this value back into the base, to decrease the loss 
while increasing the gain by a wanted scale. Or it 
could store the value back into its cache of resources. 
Table GWRT2 is based on the assumption that the triplet 
element is sufficient as variables in determining a 
best move, where there could be more than one best, 
for each move available to an agent $A$ of its 
disliking. Table GWRT1 is the preceding information 
used by the Great-Wind in determining table GWRT2, 
by some function $\Phi$. Each element in table GWRT1 
is first defined in the sense of a boolean on the 
question of the move as an effectual counteraction, 
in some sense, to the corresponding move of the agent.  

$\Phi: F \rightarrow (I,R,B);$  
$f_{jk} \texttt{ or } 0 \rightarrow (i_{jk},r_{jk},b_{jk}) \texttt{ or } 0;$  
$\texttt{j'th move of W, k'th move of A}.$  
 
The Great-Wind, being as great as its name spells 
out, would know all available moves of any autonomous 
agent it decides to antagonize. The Great-Wind also knows 
exactly what move the autonomous agent would take for 
the next timestamp. In game theoretics, these two 
abilities of the Great-Wind are <ins>perfect information</ins>, 
on and surrounding the autonomous agent's possible 
moves, and <ins>real-time acting information</ins> on the 
actual move that said agent attempts. A formula 
equipped with the feature of varying the output, given 
the same input, is used by the Great-Wind for an 
anticipated move $a_k$ by Agent $A$. The variance can be 
explained, partially, by the underlying contextual 
information the Great-Wind uses in this formula. 

$D(w_j,a_k) = S(C(b_{jk},i_{jk}),r_{jk});$  
$C \texttt{ a function transferring the inverted value }$ 
$\quad \texttt{to base } b_{jk},$  
$S \texttt{ an addition-like function comparing the modified base value of }$  
$\quad b_{jk} \texttt{ with the reversion } r_{jk}.$

For the anticipated move $a_k$ of Agent A, the Great-Wind 
prefers a move $w_j$, out of a possible arbitrary $m$ moves, 
that yields the greatest gains to it. This move preference 
is dependent on what real gains and losses of the onion-based 
force that the Agent $A$ can output, after the effects of 
reversion and the decision of transferring force from the 
inversion. 

Most autonomous agents would not have the same luxury 
of knowledge, perfect information and real-time acting 
information, as the Great-Wind. Each agent calculates their 
moves using tables similar to that of the Great-Wind. These 
next two tables show information on moves that Agent A, 
from tables GWRT1 and GWRT2, would take. 

![image info](./images/gwr_tab3.PNG)

**GWRT3:** Table showing the actions Agent A 
can take, during the stage of the smart-boa's constriction, 
given each move by the Great-Wind's onion-based pulse known 
to the agent. In this specific example, Agent A has perfect 
information of the onion-based pulse's moveset. It does not 
know what move the pulse will take. This table's non-zero 
elements comprise the complement to the table in GWRT1.

![image info](./images/gwr_tab4.PNG)

**GWRT4:** Corresponding table to table GWRT3. Each 
non-zero element is an $(offense,defense)$ value, denoting 
the effectual offense and defense of an Agent A against 
one of the Great-Wind's onion-based pulses. The term 
"offense" is to mean the force directed towards the 
onion-based pulse's move, one or more of its composition's 
mutable layers. And "defense" is the resistance, of blockage 
and absorption, against the same move. 

Table GWRT4 is lacking in specific detail. Depending on 
the complexity in solutions that is the moveset available 
to the autonomous agent, the dimensionality of values could 
be very high in number for one or both of the (offense,defense) 
values.

Some important underpinnings about the terms on the onion-based 
pulse's decision, that is "inversion","reversion", and "base", 
and for the autonomous agent, "offense" and "defense", are 
clarified next. The values concerning the terms of the 
onion-based pulse are already finalized in the table. There 
is a zero probability that any value for any triplet 
$(i,r,b)$ is incorrect. Each of the three values of the triplet 
is a value of scale by the economic decision of choosing its 
magnitude of potential in the range $[0.,1.]$. For some moves 
concerning a particular move $m_k$ by the autonomous Agent A, 
there is not much potential for inversion and reversion. The 
base value is catered according to the offense and defense of 
$m_k$. The values of the potential inversion and reversion 
are directly connected to the offense and defense, in some 
permutational and obscure way, of the agent. The agent's 
(offense,defense) values are hypothetical values, with slim 
possibilities of the values having factored in the effects 
of inversion,reversion, and the base of the pulse's pertaining 
move. The relation between the values of the pulse and those 
of the agent are coupled, in other words. For non-zero 
inversion or reversion, these values deduct the (offense,defense)
values of the agent in some way. The base value of the pulse 
is applied directly against the agent's defense and themself 
(assets and capabilities). 

Cases of agent moves uncounterable by the onion-based pulse 
are relatively easy to detect in move tables (see tables 
GWRT1,GWRT3). Any 0-column (all elements are zero) in pulse-perspective 
tables point to the agent's move for that column being completely 
uncounterable. By the agent-perspective tables, any zeroless-row 
is for a move uncounterable by the pulse. 

![image info](./images/gwr_four.PNG)

**GWR4:** Image showing layers of a portion belonging to an 
onion-based pulse. The portion is numbered in descending 
order, where the closest layer to the agent is denoted by 
the greatest number. 

The agent that has to deal with an onion-based pulse 
attempts to go past the portion that hits them. In diagram 
GWR4, the only possible destinations for escape from the 
specific portion (there could be more) would be above or 
below the portion, that is, outside of the portion's scope. 
Trickily, travelling past the 0-layer may expose the agent 
to another portion of the pulse, or a separate onion-based 
pulse, thereby continuing the risk of seizure of its 
assets and damage to its capabilities. They may discover, 
through their experience, that they cannot make cumulative 
improvements because the gains from their efforts cannot be 
retained. They may oscillate between layers near and far. 
This oscillation of sufferance is one example of the 
reactive-chain feature in use at this stage, the 
smart-boa's constriction. Factors include inversion, 
turning their energy against them. Reversion obstructs them.
And there is also the base force of the pulse's move. 
To no avail for them, so goes the Great-Wind. 

Energy is a pertinent issue for both the Great-Wind 
and any agents of its disliking. Energy is a private 
variable between these two, the Great-Wind and the agents. 
The agent/s, if more than one, may choose to share 
details on their energy with each other. Meanwhile, the 
Great-Wind does not know what energy, the maximum amount 
of exertion per agent, and the agents do not know to what 
extent of effort the Great-Wind has at its disposal. Energy 
for the Great-Wind becomes an allocation problem. It must 
calculate the energy allocated to each onion-based pulse 
it emits. Additionally, this quantity of energy is not 
merely a singular value, but one that includes the reactivity 
of the pulse. Pulses can modify their formation by use of 
its energy that it cannot increase on its own, without 
the addition of inverted force from the targeted autonomous 
agent. The amount of force each pulse gathers from its 
traversal against an agent, that is inversion in accumulation, 
serves to be recycled back at the specific location the 
agent was at, in a different portion of the pulse, or 
directed outward into the Great-Wind's store of energy.

To make matters worse for any autonomous agent that 
has to solve an oncoming onion-based pulse, the pulse 
does relay information on the reaction-chain of events, 
the actions taken by the pulse and the agent during the 
duration of activity, back to the Great-Wind. This relaying 
of information is the fundamental aspect of the reactive-chain 
improvements. The pulse may die out, with no energy left, 
due to causes that involve the superior performance of 
the agent against its actions by its design. On the other end 
of possibilities, the agent may lose their assets and have 
their capabilities restricted by the pulse, and the cause 
of this does not necessarily have to do with their bankruptcy 
of energy. If the agent manages to solve the pulse, the 
smart-boa's constriction takes the information, gathered 
from the activity in the pulse, to improve on its design 
of the next onion-based pulse it emits to the agent that 
remains.

**GWR5:** The five autonomous agents, from diagram GWR2, 
after unsuccessfully fending off the smart-boa's constriction. 

The next stage in the Great-Wind's restriction, the shadow's 
expansion, is action to reach levels acceptable enough for 
some important metrics. These metrics are <ins>adversary 
detection rate</ins>,<ins>effectual imprecision rate</ins>, 
and <ins>exit reduction</ins>, terms that have been applied 
in real-world settings before, usually with very high disregard 
for totally positive outcomes of those engaged. Pertinent 
calculations cater to the specific application. No specific 
instances of these applications need mention, but the 
prevailing practice of these calculations is to elevate the 
power of chaos. There are no formulae prescribed in large 
for chaos, especially for those that are to be subjected to 
it. 

![image info](./images/gwr_six.PNG)

**GWR6:** A networked-detection system for the autonomous 
agents in the example from diagram GWR2. Each element of 
the system is a beacon that receives accurate information 
on what adversarial threats exist in its proximity of 
finite specifics. 

Adversarial detection systems operate by two objectives: 
accurate detection and timely communication of the detection. 
The diagram GWR6 is one example of an adversarial detection 
system operating in the enclosure specified by the dashed 
lines. They are in charge of maintaining and delivering 
timely knowledge of threats detected to the five autonomous 
agents from diagram GWR1. The adversary detection rate 
falls during unreversing progress made by the shadow's 
expansion. 

![image info](./images/gwr_seven.PNG)

**GWR7:** The networked-detection system from diagram GWR6 
after it has been affected by the shadow's expansion. Green 
nodes depict nullified elements. There are exactly two 
communicative lines remaining. 

The effectual imprecision rate increases during unreversing 
progress of the shadow's expansion. The term "effectual 
imprecision" refers to the correctness of a proposed solution 
given the actual solution, such that there are more proposed 
solutions that are correct with the increase of effectual 
imprecision rate. Two illustrations, of an abstract description, 
demonstrate the growth of this metric. 

![image info](./images/gwr_eight.PNG)

**GWR8:** Red circle is the growth of effectual imprecision.

![image info](./images/gwr_nine.PNG)

**GWR9:** Green nodes are viable solutions after the growth 
of effectual imprecision. Every green node would be a 
correct solution because it leads to the original solution, 
the blue node. 

Exits can be abstracted into geometric understanding. 
In transmission design, for every enclosure, there should 
be an exit, the exit perhaps the same as the opening if 
there is only one opening. Even for verbal arguments, 
nonphysical by definition, there is the exit of refraining 
from more argument by one or more parties. The Great-Wind 
aims for exit reduction, the minimizing of number of 
openings for autonomous agents exiting out of the 
situation with the Great-Wind. 

![image info](./images/gwr_ten.PNG)

**GWR10:** The enclosure in the first diagram has less 
openings after enduring the effects of the shadow's 
expansion. The second diagram shows the enclosure of 
previous, with many openings to allow for escapes and 
inconsequential corrections in formations.

After the achievement of the shadow's expansion, finally, 
the observerless strike comes. The Great-Wind does not 
cycle through the stages of the smart-boa's constriction, 
the shadow's expansion, and the observerless strike on 
any occasion with honest observers remaining to tell the 
tale. There have been many that have attempted to replicate 
and perfect the Great-Wind's Restriction. Some found 
themselves to encounter mortal failures. 

## The Idiom and the Idiot <a name="p16"></a>

Idioms are very well-known statements, crafted by those 
that have gone through some experience, usually indescribable 
in full, that yields some insight of interest worthy enough 
to garner a following of sorts. The following preserves the 
statement that survives the trials of time well enough so 
that eventually, some time after the statement was made, 
there is the recognition that it is an idiom, a statement 
with an almost omnipotent chemistry of truth,wisdom, and 
strength through reputational survival. 

The subject in this section is tied to the section How 
Obtuse Judgments Can Count. Why would a communicative 
entity use an idiom in an arbitrary context? Is it ... 
because the idiom has positively contextual relevance 
to that context? Whyever else would the idiom be used? 
Because the idiom is an idiom due to acceptance and 
proliferation cumulatively established over quite some 
time, the usage of the idiom radiates relevance onto 
the context in such a degree that, by its own distinctive 
reputation, transcends the importance of the context 
for the connection, yes? Sure, the idiom and the context 
do not have to perfectly fit, for the connection. For 
one thing, the idiom is a principle generality and the 
context is details. The idiom is applied to the context 
to filter out the covers of misconception, streamline 
the details into shorter tidbits made more understandable, 
with the purpose of using this re-versioned context as 
the actual groundwork for furtherance in action. Nothing 
could possibly appear wrong by the metric of high 
<ins>accepting judgment</ins> belonging to those involved 
in the context that is ascribed the idiom, for their 
positive clarification recognized by their judgment. 

The effects of the idiom present themselves in two aspects 
of importance, in the temporal sense relative to the 
occurrence of an event or sequence of events, and as 
a tool by the "originators" and the "adopters" who 
incorporated it after. 

There are questions concerning the "birth" of an idiom, 
this "birth" not singular as in one point of time, but 
many through the transmission of many minds, usually 
from many tongues, perhaps many books in societies that 
have industrialized non-auditory communication. If the 
idiom is a material object, though only in a bizarre world, 
it very well could pose as one of the material wonders 
of the world. The idiom that comes after the sequence 
of event/s is a hindsight. This hindsight may be an 
epiphany not yet formalized into that which is the 
officious idiom, or it could be a reflection which 
reinforces the idiom as the source for frequent 
reference, with the actual truthfulness by accurate 
correlation on an accepted axis of understanding 
left up for question in the specifics of the context. 
The thought, expressed in terms of advice, on events 
in a future near or far given what is available by 
judgment through perception and beyond thus far, 
is a premonition of sorts. The thought is expressed 
with certain kinds of undertones intended to signify 
premonitory wisdom and visions of the future granted 
from the energy of the past. If the thought is already 
well established in terms of use and adherence, the 
thought is an idiom. If it is not an idiom, but it 
proves to be correct from the judgment of those that 
have been transmitted the thought from others before 
passing through some pertaining events that was the 
future, then there is the confidence of belief by the 
participants transferred to the credibility of the 
thought, a possibly eventual idiom. 

The idiom is ushered to uphold confidence in an 
applicable future at elevatable levels of motivation, 
with regards to some action planned to be taken and 
with rationale that rests on it, the idiom. The idiom 
ushered afterwards is used as clarification on what 
mistakes in thought or action occurred. There is the 
"if the idiom was taken as the wisdom before the 
action, the mistake would not have occurred." 
Additionally, the idiom does not have to focus on 
clarifying mistakes in thought or action, to clarify; 
rather, it can well serve as a rationale for the 
inevitable, in place of the incomprehensibly scientific 
explanation.

**IATI1:** A body of information, with every variable 
having an inverted version of itself. 

Diagram IATI1 is a geometric visualization of a body 
of information structured in the manner of a triangle. 
The two bottom ends are those for the polar extremities 
in views regarding a topic. The other end, at the top, 
represents a central perspective. Every $n_i^{(?)}$ 
is a variable in the topic. Triangles are rather 
simplistic in the sense that there are only three 
sides, of vertices or edges. The triangle is the idiom. 
The objective is for those comprehending the topic, in a full 
and confident sense, to "neutralize" the variables (the 
topic) by an ideal split onto the topic. The split produces 
at least two pieces, such that comparing the pieces 
with each other cancels out the variables to 1, as in 
one solution. The result is worked for the objective 
of no doubt by way of questionable variables; all 
variables are questionable in this paradigm. Undoubtedly, 
diagram IATI1 is one of many candidate models representing 
information due to be rationalized in some way. There 
is the conventional wisdom that any model is as good as 
the specific problem it faces. The model does work 
as a preliminary representation of a topic due to 
be comprehended in some sense that is under the 
application of an idiom, the triangle. 

![image info](./images/iati_two.PNG)

**IATI2:** A split onto the same body of information 
from diagram IATI1. The split neutralizes all variables, 
by the comparison of the two resulting halves.

![image info](./images/iati_three.PNG)

**IATI3:** An erroneous split onto the body of information 
from diagram IATI1. The split neutralizes only variable 
$n_6$. 

There are some ways to validate performing a split 
that results in remaining variables, such as in diagram 
IATI3. One way is the rather classic weight-assignment 
approach. Simply assign the weight $w=1.0$ to variables 
$n_6^{(1)}$ and $n_6^{(-1)}$. The product is $1.0 * w=1.0$.
Assign the weight $0.0$ to all the other variables, so that 
$0.0 * n_i^{(?)}$ outputs $0.0$. If the best split for 
a topic under the application of an idiom cannot be done, 
the idiom could much still be applied. The errors in the 
reasoning, if reasoning could really be made objective 
in these contexts, would be brushed aside as an 
<ins>unrecognized misapplication</ins> of the idiom. 

Diagrams IATI2 and IATI3 show the same body of information, 
but are under non-identical idioms. The changing relations 
between the interpreter and the expressor of idioms, due 
to the psycholinguistic underpinnings of natural languages 
in spoken or written forms, place unspoken demands on 
what relevance the topic is in relation to the inarguable 
greatness of the idiom, by its statistical frequency grown 
through legacy. The idiom could be used as a commentary 
statement on the deterministic way in which some events 
transpired, for instance. To elaborate on this, there is 
the sentiment that things may have seemed different, but 
because some of those things have relations with some of 
the aspects of the idiom, then the outcome of the idiom 
and of those things, with details maybe out of line with 
any of the idiom, are one and the same. As a result, the 
idiom persists, as strong as its accumulated acceptance 
continues to allow it. The expressor of the idiom lends 
themself the image of the legacy's truthfulness behind 
the idiom. This aspect called the truthfulness of legacy 
is a boost in the believability, that is confidence, of 
the idiom's attachment to its application. The idiom, as 
a label for a statement, is not confined to the roles of 
positive or negative application. The idiom does not have 
to be an encouragement for some wanted future. Instead, 
it can be a planned future's discouragement, to steer 
the reception to an alternative future after the hopeful 
change of their decisions. The idiom, past the events, 
does not have to be an insight of wisdom that can help 
for a brighter future. Instead, the idiom may just as 
well be a statement on the darkness, the tragedy of 
how events played out without the guidance of the 
same idiom if considered before all the happenings. 
The expressor of the idiom does not have to be a 
steadfast practitioner of the idiom. The expressor 
may express the idiom after the overcoming of their 
doubts, through their experience, on the idiom's 
truthfulness. The steadfast practitioner employs 
the idiom in the manner of their own construct 
regarding justice, and as such, does not find the 
task of contradicting the idiom through their 
expression of open acknowledgment on the idiom's 
shortcomings to be pleasant. And there are also 
those that enjoy expressing idioms half-heartedly, 
perhaps posing as fully-forward in physical appearance 
to maintain credibility by others' beliefs, due 
to their shortcomings in understanding or a desire 
to not reveal some topic in full. Some users of 
the idiom may hold the objective to be as great 
as the tool that is the idiom, when they are, in fact, 
those in control of the intangible tool that must 
cross their mind before the tool's outward expression. 
From a pure utilitarian perspective, that which 
emphasizes the effectiveness in usage above all 
else, the user can be only as great as a combinatorial 
fusing of the greatness of the tool and the tool's 
use. In the curious case of idioms, the psychological 
effects of language, when considered as transmissive 
elements that can then fuel autonomous decisions for 
futures not dared to be taken without that fuel, 
is certainly an objective for some in their ongoing 
duties to maintain their image by the continuation 
of power lent to them from the idiom, the tool, that 
they use. 

Continuing on the discussion of the idiom in the 
temporal sense, maybe the outcome is the only "thing" 
that matters to the participants of the idiom. There 
is the primary expressor/s of the idiom, and then 
the followers of that idiom given to them by the 
expressor/s. There is the sentiment, to go against 
the "ultimate meaning" of the idiom would not bode 
well for the participants, despite what given 
information and corresponding conclusions can be made. 
There is no proof of what is yet to come. Rely on 
the strength of the idiom that already exists, due 
to its merit survived and grown through legacy over 
time, or fall back on nothing as guidance, instead 
having to resort to chaotic, risk-taking, and formless 
efforts to succeed at the objective.

**IATI4:** Triangle represents the hierarchy of a 
set of participants, denoted by variables $y_{?}^{(?)}$. 
The participants are to move forward with attempting 
to accomplish the objective, as the orange node. Each 
participant's default (independent behavior) is to 
travel completely straight up (at a 90 degree angle 
to themself as the reference). However, after the 
hierarchy of participants regrouped to formulate a 
plan to proceed with accomplishing the objective, 
each of them bends their thoughts and actions, 
represented by the angular arcs of their upward 
travel. Their travel merges at a single destination 
point (the idiom), before the combined force proceeds straight 
upward in the attempt to accomplish the objective 
(orange node). 

Diagram IATI4 shows a different model, regarding 
idioms, than that of diagrams IATI2 and IATI3. The 
model is an objective-based model that uses the 
triangle as a hierarchy of participants. The model's 
triangle in diagrams IATI2 and IATI3 serve as 
containers of information, the information to be 
rationalized by splitting said container. The diverse 
number of models available to serve different aspects 
of the same problem, or the same problem itself, is 
a testament to the plasticity of model-based decision-making. 
If one model does not suit the wanted objective, another 
model would be used if there are no restrictions on what 
models are used, only the expectation that some outcome is 
successfully reached. Usage of idioms in cases such as in 
diagram IATI4 are to manipulate confidence towards efforts 
previously unconsidered. As such, models such as these 
are questionable by their strength's reliance on 
manipulation of will and whim, instead of providing 
fact-based information to autonomous and independent 
decision-makers. 

Definitive explanations of why the confidence in something, 
such as the idiom, is a modifiable trait in belief (intrinsic 
possession) by either the expressor or the participants 
falls on variables outside of the scope of specific clarity. 
The relation between perception and judgment has been talked 
about in the section How Obtuse Judgments Can Count, but 
there are certainly questions remaining on the infinitesimally 
material components involved. There are a few areas in the 
high-level context, such as the outcome of the actions taken 
by participants under the idiom, and the participant's volition, 
under variable circumstances, to "break free" from acting under 
the idiom. Some relations are in need to be stated. For the 
outcome of an accomplished objective, there is a validation 
of the peak: the idiom stays true to its reputation as a truth, 
the expressor is righteous for utilizing it, and the remaining 
participants fare well in some shape and form for obedience 
to the idiom that is passed down to them from the expressor. 
Perhaps even in failed outcomes or outcomes labeled victorious 
but with grievous casualties of sorts, the decision to use the 
idiom as the launching point of action (refer back to diagram 
IATI4) could certainly still be justified. High-priority members 
of a hierarchy, including the expressor, would attempt to 
persuade those underneath, befuddled by the platitudes in 
details of variance amongst their references and themselves, 
that what actions that have taken place under the idiom and 
for the objective is reasonable, and thus righteous, even 
with whatever losses occurred. A step further in pacifying 
what remains of the unity of disbelief surrounding the idiom 
would be to declare that those disbelievers failed to uphold 
the idiom, and this is evident due to the results obtained. 

The "originators" and the "adopters" of the idiom are 
defined not as absolutes. The relation between those 
that are the "originators", first to know and use the 
idiom, and the "adopters" that were transmitted the 
knowledge of the idiom from them is one of ordering. 
The originators are labeled this in relation to those. 
Practically every entity is an adopter, in some degree, 
to the idiom that has one or a few "originators" at its 
birth. The idiom grows by retention of users, as already 
noted. Then the idiom reaches a point of equilibrium 
in the number of adopters. Historically, the idiom is 
of a regional existence. The idiom is used in the manner 
of a cultural identifier. Those of a certain region may 
have knowledge of a particular idiom in their early years of 
existence, so think that idiom to be natural as a mental 
construct for rationalizing about their experience, 
such as their social interactions and perception of 
surroundings. 

After the idiom has reached an equilibrium in scale 
of adoption, there may be newcomers that proceed to 
using the idiom after they themselves adopt it. The 
idiom, in its domain, is first learned by the newcomer 
in the newcomer's quest to learn more and "fit in" with 
the domain. The newcomer adopts the idiom, then uses 
the idiom in the manner of an entry point, from one 
stranger to another bound by the medium of trust or 
similarity that is the idiom. 

![image info](./images/iati_five.PNG)

**IATI5:** Domain of the idiom is the square enclosure 
marked by $D$. Agent $A$, the newcomer, has a few options 
for gaining acceptance into enclosure $D$. The newcomer 
can use the idiom $I$, as their introduction, with at 
most fifty-percent of failure. Or the newcomer can use 
other mechanisms (the black dots), with unknown 
probabilities of failure, instead. 

The newcomer that adopts the idiom is motivated by 
the fact that using it would serve as a shared commonality 
with members of the idiom's domain. The idiom is frequently 
thought of as a middle ground for newcomers' gaining entry, 
since it is above the nicety-basics of communicative 
interaction, yet below the jeopardizing risk of private 
matters. Surely, the idiom is upheld there in its 
domain due its reception of great esteem by the members 
of the domain. For the members to take offense to the 
idiom's utterance, even by a newcomer, would be to 
disregard the unifying influence of the idiom as a top 
priority, and instead to focus on the newcomer as a 
suspected antagonist. Meanwhile, the newcomer takes 
care not to partake in behavior or other appearances 
that may lead to some that are not the elites, the 
authorities that uphold the idiom as the ideal that 
governs one of their institutions or their society 
overall, to suspect the newcomer of harboring malice 
of some sorts. The newcomer uses tools such as idioms 
in their attempt to participate in the shared sense of 
belonging in the domain.

Extending out of the scope of the idiom as an 
introductory tactic by the newcomer into a domain, the 
idiom acts as a bonding mechanism between two or more 
people. The idiom becomes the first and foremost shared 
commonality between them. From the acknowledgment of 
the idiom from the two or more ends, interaction builds 
on this trust to become more personalized and also 
privatized. There may come times when relations between 
two or more entities are tested by adverse events. And 
during these times, the entities may very well fall back 
on their shared commonality from the start, the idiom 
that gave their relation the chance to flourish.

**IATI6:** Progression of two agents $A_0$ (orange) and 
$A_1$ (blue), over the course of six timestamps. At 
the first timestamp, the agents bond by idiom $I$. Then 
for timestamps 2-4, each of the agents conduct separate 
activities, denote by nodes identically colored 
as the agents, in harmony. The activities still share 
positive connectivity, by the dashed green lines. Then 
at timestamp 5, there is a problem that occurs, impeding 
on the progress made by the two agents. The efforts are 
re-routed back to the starting point of unification, 
at the idiom.

There is not much to be discussed on the term "idiot". 
By many accounts, the term "idiot" means to describe 
one that is not a participant in whatever process is 
of vital essence to something of an important 
caliber, at least in the official sense, such as 
politics. For one to describe another as an "idiot" 
may be not an insult whatsoever, nothing more than 
a differentiator between those who strongly or actively 
seek to participate in some process and those that 
abstain or are excluded. With idioms, suppose an "idiot" 
is one that does not participate in the thinking behind 
the expression of an idiom, not the one with the motive 
for an action or acknowledgment. Instead, the "idiot" 
would stay silent and obey the expressor of the idiom. 
The "idiot" would be the one that accepts the consequences 
stemming from the faulty use of an idiom. Also, the "idiot" 
would nonchalantly accept the riches and spoils from the 
wins made by activity under the guidance of an idiom. 
Perhaps the "idiot" alongside the idiom is one that does 
not recognize the essence of the idiom in applied contexts. 
There is a mismatch when the "idiot" is coupled with the 
idiom. Something is expected to go terribly wrong. The 
"idiot" could involuntarily commit error. The term 
"idiot" does carry a consequentialist aura on the "idiot" 
as the sufferer that may spread their suffering to others 
that would not be thrilled to experience losses not of 
their own doing, due to the "idiot"'s apathetic behavior and 
attitudes towards fundamental activity, that which relies 
on principles such as idioms to thrive. But the translation 
between words and actions do muddle the recognition, 
beforehand and afterwards, on what idiocy truly is. The 
one that is ascribed as an "idiot" because they are not 
the expressor, the ideal, the representative of the idiom 
could actually have put or be putting their efforts 
elsewhere for effects far greater in gains or losses 
than words as powerful in legacy as the idiom. 

## Half-Efforts, Full Takes <a name="p17"></a>

A common line of reasoning persists in many activities 
demarcated by start and end points. This line is the 
input-output expectation, reinforced if not derived by 
scientific laws surrounding the zero-sum condition of 
energy: what efforts and materials go into an "outlet" 
must come out of the "outlet" in ways that are equal 
to the input's totality, but open to changes in form 
and expression. The openness to changes in form and 
expression allows for dashing of the expectations 
for the output. This section observes some aspects 
in the way efforts are manifested by forces such as 
the acting agent of those efforts and others outside 
of the direct efforts in action taken. 

One major area of focus is <ins>operational efficiency</ins>. 
The objective behind this form of efficiency is to 
reduce expenses in work and material, with regards to 
defined activity, below a threshold to an expected 
optimal level. From this central problem comes 
other related problems, to be gradually mentioned. 
In this first context, there are an arbitrary number 
of tasks $T$ to be completed, by an $x$ number of 
workers. An even partitioning of work between the $x$ 
workers, for these tasks' completion, is established 
at the beginning. Each worker is to complete a portion 
that is $\frac{1}{x}$ of every task belonging to $T$. 
The two facets for efficiency measurement are time, 
what each worker can accomplish given a set amount 
of time, and space, what each worker requires (capital, 
resources) to do their amount of work. Notions that 
revolve around the concept of <ins>ideal proportionality</ins> 
are used to judge the correctness of the details 
that concern the workers. Judgments of ideal proportionality 
grow in complexity by the dimensionality in variables. 
For singular values such as integers, the integer is 
divided by another number, typically an integer denoting 
the number of candidates that the singular value is 
to be split between. With the addition of more values 
to be considered in terms of proportionality, there 
becomes more candidates to consider, and usually 
more solutions as well in comparison to the proportionality 
of singular values. From an arithmetic approach on 
numerical variables, a "fitting" problem is the 
predominant route of structuring the problem in 
order to obtain a satisfying solution. The "fitting" 
problem involves finding an associated weight, to be 
used as an operand such as a multiplier, for each of 
the variables, so that the cumulative output from the 
variables each attached to their associated weight 
satisfies some condition. High likelihood of multiple 
satisfying solutions for the "fitting" problem, of 
arbitrary variable dimensions, comes from 
<ins>inter-variable compensation</ins>. 

![image info](./images/heft_one.PNG)

**HEFT1:** Three tasks are split between five 
workers. The average amount of completion towards 
each task is $1/5 = 0.2$. However, only one 
worker, $w_2$, was able to meet this mean requirement 
for all of the tasks. The fact remains, even with 
these output discrepancies between the workers, that 
all of the tasks were completed (each column sums to 
$1.0$). The mathematical equation to determine if the 
workers conducted satisfying work in table HEFT1 
is straightforward. 

$$\begin{equation}
f(t_i) = 
     \begin{cases}
      \text{pass} & \text{ if }\sum_{w_i \in W}t_{i}^{(w_i)}=1.0 \\ 
      \text{fail} & \text{otherwise.} \\ 
     \end{cases}
\end{equation}$$

If every task $t_i$ of the tasks $T$ is satisfied by 
the cumulative work completed by the workers, so that 
the completion is $1.0$ for all, then the workers 
have performed satisfying work by the metric of function 
$f$. As always with there always being a critic, there 
is another function $g$. 

$$\begin{equation}
g(w_i) = 
     \begin{cases}
      \text{pass} & \text{ if } t_{i}^{(w_i)}\geq 1.0/|W| \forall t_{i} \in T \\ 
      \text{fail} & \text{otherwise.} \\ 
     \end{cases}
\end{equation}$$

Function $g$ determines that a worker $w_i$ passes if 
their output per task is at least as great as the mean, 
a value that is set to the even split of work between 
all workers $W$. With a mere two examples for work-performance 
functions, there is already the question of ideal 
proportionality, the concept recently mentioned. Must 
every worker meet at least the "minumum" threshold that 
is the expected mean work for each task? Should not 
the completion of all the tasks be a criteria of higher 
priority? 

A "fair balance" could be established to resolve this 
issue of preferring one over the other. Establish a 
value $q$ that serves as a singular value for minimum 
performance requirement, and also an associated weight 
$x_i$ for each of the $t_i$ tasks. A worker $w_i$ passes 
their work requirement if this inequality is satisfied, 
for $n$ number of tasks.

$$\begin{equation}
x_0t_{i}^{(w_i)} + \dots + x_{n-1}t_{n-1}^{(w_i)} \geq q.
\end{equation}$$

**EQW0:** The weighted-work requirement inequality. 

Another dimension regarding work in the practical sense 
must be considered for a comprehensive overview. Payments. 
Payments usually take the form of an established currency. 
If payments are not in the order, then the work that each 
worker contributes to the demanded tasks, not necessarily 
the efforts that they expend, is what they are paid in 
as a direct result of their efforts. The workers could 
certainly barter their products, borne from the work, 
for other products if currency is not allowed. The 
exchange rate in these situations is arbitrarily-defined, 
and barter has historically been used in place of a 
lack of commonality, between two or more entities involved 
in the process of exchange, in judgment criteria more 
layered than direct material. 

On the matter of payments, there are only a few broad 
approaches that are possible. Payments do follow some 
guideline that pertains to the concept of ideal 
proportionality, and additionally is along the lines of 
the base scientific principle of input-output expectation. 
Payments of currency are an <ins>externally-sourced gain</ins> 
for the receivers. The source of the currency received 
by each worker is not physically tied to the efforts 
that they expend. The source of the currency may belong 
to the organization that each worker is a part of, such 
as from a financial officer. But the financial officer 
is also somehow tied to the authorities of the currency 
issued to them, the officer, for them to transmit to 
their workers as payment for their work. 

Payments could take the form of a flat rate, that is, 
according to the time spent working. Every worker, 
regardless of their individual contributions to the 
completion of each demanded task, is paid the exact 
same amount, given the condition that they all work 
the same amount of time. Payments could also take 
the form of a weighted rate that takes into consideration 
each worker's individual contribution, such that 
their greater magnitude in contribution results in 
their being paid more. Again, these two approaches face 
the same issue as the previously mentioned functions, 
$f$ and $g$, as the preferred method of use. There 
is the "fair balance" approach for this. 

$$\begin{equation}
c_0t_{i}^{(w_i)} + \dots + c_{n-1}t_{n-1}^{(w_i)} \leq q_2.
\end{equation}$$

**EQW1:** The weighted-payment requirement inequality. 

Inequality EQW1 is a preliminary attempt to resolve 
the question of payments. Each worker $w_i$ is paid 
the amount that is the expression on the left-hand 
side. To ensure fairness by reducing the possibility 
of over-performing outliers, there is the maximum 
threshold of $q_2$ set. Using the inequality EQW1 
along with EQW0, a worker is judged to be a fitting 
worker if they are paid at most $q_2$ and output 
efforts condensed into a singular value at least that 
of $q$. 

There are some concerns on the metric of cumulative 
product from work, previously mentioned as the generic 
function $f$. The concerns focus on the two extremes 
of the workers, the over-workers and under-workers. 
The over-workers exceed the expected mean, this 
usually the work requirement, and the under-workers 
the opposite. There is the issue with the 
externally-sourced gain of payments, compared 
between these two. Already, perceived indiscrepancies 
could evolve into great sources of envy amongst 
the working peers. Another issue has to do with the 
experience, of physical/mental stress and improvements 
in work ethic or knowledge base, between these two 
categories of workers. There is also the issue that 
is not directly related to the work itself, but how 
the workers of excess performance fare outside of 
their work environment, in comparison to the workers 
that do not put in the equivalent amount of work and 
may gear their efforts towards other activities 
outside of work. The metric of cumulative product 
from work is an <ins>equal-outcome expression</ins>. 
The perception that one outcome in one work session 
is equal to the outcome of another work session, 
and thus equal by the workers for the workers, is 
a perception that is ignorant of each of the workers' 
performance, the underlying building blocks for the 
whole. The criteria for judgment on performance, 
as a collective VS individual, is a central 
determinant on the amount of influence such perceptions 
carry. The metric of the individual average, in other 
words, the individual meeting the average across all 
relevant variables, also carries with it a certain kind 
of negativity in reception. Averages are quintessentially 
antithetical to specialization, another ideal highly-sought 
after. Specialization comes later in this section's discussion. 

<ins>Collective bargaining</ins>, by the workers, consists 
of negotiating activities to guarantee minumum and/or maximum 
thresholds on variables deemed important to worker livelihood. 
Payment and insurance are two of the highest-ranking variables 
on the long list. This form of negotiation is a universal 
approach in social-based systems, albeit the goals and terms 
of this negotiation do possess the risk of failure through 
generalization of individual expectations and unaffordable 
burdens on the support system that is responsible for 
upholding said terms for said goals. There has been much 
scholarly research into and practice of collective bargaining 
in work settings, especially those of material goods production. 
Depending on the ideological style of the socio-economic 
administration above the workers in authoritative command 
flow, collective bargaining is one of the foremost methods 
in negotiation, due to the emphasis on reaching and then 
maintaining a flat line with respect to the variables of 
worker livelihood. Those workers that find some of their 
demands in work to remain unmet or entirely discouraged 
by the outcome of collective bargaining have degrees of 
freedom in their proceeding actions that strongly correlate 
to the expectations and potential force of their socio-economic 
administration. A review of the ideological and political 
favorings that socio-economic administrations have attempted, 
historically up to this day, falls outside of this work's 
genericization that is to not reach into the depths of 
hyper-detailed happenings and arrangements comprised of 
ethno-national,cultural, and regional tints. 

Collective bargaining observes some variables worthy 
of mention: 
- each worker's expectations (demands) of their assigned 
  work,
- qualities of each worker's output, including their 
  energy expenditure (effort), contribution to the 
  completion of the task/s, and maximum capabilities, 
- negotiated terms of collective work expectations
- qualities of each worker's output after implementation 
  of collective negotiated terms,
- effects of each worker's expectations (demands) that 
  were unmet due to the collective bargaining process. 

This section now turns to the label of workers as being 
specialized. Work, as a general term for efforts expended 
to accomplish some arbitrary objective, cannot be thought 
of as a sequence of efforts to be taken by a physically 
capable entity. This thought as an equation lacks that 
very frequent term used to gauge the effectiveness of a 
worker. That very frequent term is "experience". The 
reasoning is, without the experience that is vital to 
the successful execution of the work that is to be done 
by any physically capable entity, that entity could not 
accomplish the work. They may "know the form but not the 
way", or they may "know the way but not the form", and 
as a result of their satisfying one but not the other, 
they cannot do the work that is specialized with respect 
to their ordinariness. 

Refer back to table HEFT1 on the worker output of three 
demanded tasks. All of the workers are expected to be of 
the same status, even though the word "status" was not 
explicitly mentioned. This idea of the workers' equal 
statuses to each other comes down to the mean expected 
contribution they are to each output for each of the 
demanded tasks. Contribution to each of the demanded 
tasks, by all involved workers, also implies that 
every worker is capable of accomplishing each of the 
tasks. But the values in the table tell something 
else from their variance between each other. Workers 
$w_2$, $w_3$, and $w_0$ are the "best" workers by 
their greatest contributions for tasks $t_2$, $t_1$, 
and $t_0$, respectively. Factors such as output-agnostic 
payment and certain conceptualizations of ideal proportionality 
would strongly suggest that these workers become 
specialized for their task that they excel at, in 
the name of operational efficiency for <ins>methodological 
improvement</ins>. By this suggestion, work-allocation 
decisions to specialize the workers by compartmentalizing 
their activity and interaction into certain channels, 
non-existing in equal-work environments, naturally places 
demands on the workers unique by their specialization. 
The objective is for each of the workers, with some 
natural inclination at a task, to progressively improve 
their natural inclination. In turn, greater workers 
for a greater whole should be the summary line from the 
overall review of the workers, after their undergoing 
specialization in tasks. These marked improvements also 
should, in implementation of the theoretics stemming 
from operational efficiency, result in the workers being 
paid the same amount as without their specialization, 
such as in environments of equal roles as equal statuses.

A frequent underlying drive to specialize is the situation 
of worker overflow, a problem that takes forms in reference 
to the input and the output. In one form that is the constraint 
of input sources, suppose there is a task $t_i$ to be completed, 
and the task requires the worker to be at positions $\{p_1,\dots,p_m\}$. 
A spare number of workers greater than $m$ would not 
positively affect the outcome. Instead, the workers 
would have to conduct other activity on the sidelines 
of the actual task to be completed. In the situation 
of table HEFT1, there is no excess or deficit in the 
completion of the demanded tasks. If a task is able to 
be completed and for there to be excess output from 
work on the task, usually by material or acting outcomes 
from the task, the practice of operational efficiency 
entails removing the sources of that excess. 

A related category of work to worker overflow is the 
<ins>permutative work process</ins>. To exemplify, for 
a task $t_i$ to be completed, the task could additionally 
be split into smaller tasks called steps. A permutative 
arrangement calls for these steps to be executed in an 
appropriate ordering. The workers responsible for the 
completion of this task may discover that their individual 
strengths in steps of the tasks collide with one 
another's work, so partitioning schemes to minimize this 
colliding work negation, a waste, may demand worker 
specialization. Rubrics and regulations tend to be 
established for specialization pathways. Despite the 
rarity of the specialist, the specialist is not expected 
to be of a genuinely unique sort, by the metric of the 
novelty of their work. Two traits that serve as better 
distinguishers of a specialist than their work's novelty 
are: 
- rarity among their working peers,
- initial aptitude to be placed on the specialization pathway, 
  alongside the rigor in standards for their recognition 
  as a specialist. 

Trials and errors may have needed to take place to "pave 
the way" for the area of specialization to become recognized 
as the objective. Organizations with objectives to 
specialize do restructure their form and purposes to 
suit these objectives, with questions on their successes 
remaining. 

The idea of half-efforts, full takes has been demonstrated 
in one form, the equal-outcome expression that enables 
workers to stray away from the expected mean output for 
each demanded task, of inter-worker leverage. Focus is 
now shifted to the concept of a <ins>contested environment</ins>. 
Thorough descriptions of contested environments encapsulate 
more than the explicit mention of the workers, the tasks 
they are expected to complete, and their socio-economic 
administration. Metrics, measurements designed to gauge 
the effectiveness of a worker by their work and the 
potential of the worker to conduct other work, are typically 
based on scientific principles, perhaps maybe pushing into 
the terrain of national/cultural norms accepted as the 
truths for the time and the space. Numerical manipulation 
of aspects concerning metrics, such as raising or lowering 
the expected measurement of a metric, utilizing metrics 
outdated or out of touch with the context, and mismeasurements 
by the metric should be the expectation in improperly 
regulated environments, these environments technically 
contested by the volatile lack of basis. 

In one form of a contested environment, there is a 
task $t_i$ to be completed by the workers. Besides from 
the condition that $t_i$ is completed, there is also 
the demand for each of the workers to attempt to work 
in excess of the completion of $t_i$. To work in excess, 
to progressively improve the output of the task $t_i$'s 
completion iteration over iteration, and for this work 
to positively measure in comparison with other workers, 
is the objective of each of the workers in this kind 
of contested environment: <ins>boundless competitive 
output</ins>. In another form of a contested environment, 
there is a task $t_j$ to be completed by the workers. 
There are <ins>unregulated guarantees</ins>. Possible 
conditions established through collective bargaining by 
the workers are ignored, mismanaged, or entirely violated 
by either the workers or their socio-economic administration. 

More forms of contested environments exist; these ones 
rely on <ins>metric-less work</ins>. In metric-less work, 
there are less objective measures available for the 
socio-economic administration to gauge the effectiveness 
of each worker. Activities such as research, the arts 
and design, policing (questionably), and non-profiting 
social services are examples that are difficult to gauge 
in quality, despite there being obvious ways such as 
statistical frequency counts. Two workers in a metric-less 
work environment may expend as much energy as one another 
in fulfilling a task. The manifestation of this task's 
completion takes many forms as the acceptable output. One 
worker produces a different product than the other, and is 
greatly rewarded in currency payments, while the other 
does not receive any currency payment whatsoever. In 
another example of a metric-less work environment, one 
worker is able to use the other worker's work as a 
critical step towards outputting a product. The 
worker is greatly rewarded in currency payments, and 
the other goes bankrupt. The outputs from metric-less 
work are products outside of the scope of their 
immediate reference. What is worthless for their 
time may, in fact, become priceless by its exorbitant 
valuation at a future near or far. For example, a worker 
expends their efforts for a product $p$. The product 
$p$ is deemed worthless by their socio-economic 
administration, so they are not paid whatsoever, 
instead having to receive ridicule from their peers, 
as well as export control measures and regulations 
from their socio-economic administration. After the 
worker passed away, the socio-economic administration 
rediscovered that their product $p$ actually does 
carry tangible value. The administration sells the 
product $p$ to their competitor for an exorbitant 
sum of currency payments, and the members of the 
administration are able to pay off their debt by 
this exorbitant sum. 

Forms of contested environments such as the 
mentioned boundless competitive output, unregulated 
guarantees, and metric-less work can be used in 
campaigns such as the <ins>output-delusion scheme</ins>. 
What is half-efforts, full takes again? In these 
environments, there is the openness in interpretation 
by the workers and their socio-economic administration 
of the rules and regulations. To add onto this subjectivity, 
the socio-economic administration could execute stated 
rules and regulations by a whimsical style. Worker 
performance, measured by their output that is put into 
a light of subjectivity, could furthermore be skewed 
in reception. The worker that expends more effort could 
be subject to greater scrutiny. The worker that plays 
by the "rules and regulations", of a whimsical enactment, 
could be socio-economically rewarded at a greater scale 
than others that have expended more effort for products 
of a potentially greater value, but failed to play by 
the same "rules and regulations".

**HEFT2:** A worker-administrator graphical unit 
that is comprised of four main entities: the workers 
(W), the administration (A), an arbitrarily-defined 
channel to currency (red ??), and a currency authority ($$). 
The worker works, by function $f_w$, for their 
socio-economic administration. The socio-economic 
administration pays the worker currency in exchange 
by one of two ways. It can pay the worker through 
its own currency reserves, or it can take the 
additional step of attempting to retrieve currency 
from a currency authority, by its function $f_c$. 
The socio-economic administration also has the 
possibility of connecting to another worker-administrator 
graphical unit (gray ??) for work to be done ($f_w$), to be 
provided currency ($f_c$), or to provide currency ($). 

The <ins>worker-administrator graphical unit</ins>, of 
diagram HEFT2, should be not interpreted as the 
universal model for work arrangements that involve 
currency; claiming that this graphical unit does serve 
as the universal model for such activity would probably 
be challenged in some way. But it does provide enough 
capabilities to account for factors of advanced or large 
networks. Additionally, the abstract functions $f_w$ and 
$f_c$ indicate the wide possible spectrum of currency 
payments the socio-economic administration has at its 
control, and what lack or excess of currency payments the 
worker is subject to. Half-efforts, taken by the administration, 
and full takes, for the administration, should be relatively 
easy to calculate using the worker-administrator graphical 
unit as the model for operating on economic and financial 
conditions. 

Worker-administrator dynamics provide a full template 
for discussion on the category of the <ins>open-gain 
environment</ins>. The worker in this environment is 
not attached to the administrator, for an indeterminate 
amount of time, in a feedback loop of completing tasks 
demanded of them, in order to receive currency from the 
administrator. In conservative worker-administrator 
dynamics, the work environment is designed to ensure 
the command-flow, from the administrator to the worker, 
remains intact in hierarchical relation. Preventative 
measures are put in place to prevent the command-flow 
from caving in: the worker quits or is fired for 
insubordination, or the worker assumes the role of 
an administrator that usurps their current administrator. 
Rationing of currency payments is a typical route to 
ensure that the worker does not accumulate enough 
power, per se, in the form of excess currency that they 
could divert towards other outlets in competition against 
the administration. In open-gain environments, the 
worker could expect that their efforts expended would 
yield them at least an equal output back to them. This 
output, the product itself, currency, or an exchanged 
product, would mean no losses of measurable value 
back to them. The worker may even acquire a lot of 
currency, many times that of their peers that put 
in the same amount of work, due to currency constraints 
placed on their peers while they have the liberty 
of no maximal constraints with currency payments. 
The category of open-gain environments is a term to 
generalize the lack of conservative arrangements, 
on the matter of product, product valuation, and 
continual lack of change in relations between the 
workers and the administrators. 

## Arguments in Image-Projectable Contexts <a name="p18"></a>

Much interest is taken in the field of argument 
construction and execution, driven by demands in 
defensive competency. Demands in this field are 
somehow spurred through the spontaneity of the 
experience and the experience's ensuing reflection, 
and in many cases, compulsions to gain competency 
in this field are not innate, rather passed down 
in constructs keen on maintaining a vigilance 
that operates on the belief of continual sources 
of threats, uncontrollable and maybe unhelpable 
in juxtaposition to the self capable of its own 
improvement. The idea of the "self" and the "other" 
as a dualistic combination that becomes connected 
by great flux, asymmetry, or other mechanisms of 
polarity and separation is not the main topic 
in this discussion. The argument as the tool and 
the context as the operating environment with 
specific variables of qualities such as restriction, 
constraint, and derivation is the specific sub-field 
in defense that is detailed. The choice of using the 
term "defense" instead of "offense" is due to 
notions, to be explained, that emphasize how 
certain offenses occur without ignoring their 
implicit weaknesses of their forward force (that is 
usually how offense occurs), for that would allow 
there to be conceptualizations expressed, justifiable 
through their lack of opposing views as grounds for 
oppositional debate, of the offense as being impeccable, 
godlike in another word. 

The term "argument" is a term predominantly used as a 
label for verbal or written forms of opposition and/or 
antagonism against one side, perhaps a null side, in favor 
of another perspective from its own rationale, with options 
of promoting partiality through the engineering of 
opinions and biases. Arguments have orientations according 
to a polarity of sorts, since they fall in the spectrum 
of promotion and contradiction. Predominant forms of 
what are called arguments do not require there to be 
a rubric for civility or peacekeeping, disappointly 
for many that rely on verbal and written forms in 
their existential interests, but universalism in 
implementations of civility and peacekeeping encountered 
variants of differing styles with magnetic properties 
in binding and repulsing, with the resultant from 
these implementations non-constant by the observation 
of images comprised of the pertinent structures and 
behaviors. The term "fight" is a synonymous one to 
"argument", but its use, as a descriptor for non-uniting 
phenomena between autonomous entities, veers to those 
events with more volatile and/or violent practices for 
outcomes that have higher probabilities of the relation 
between the participants to be irreparable. The preferential 
usage of these synonyms in the human sense is not this section's 
prime crux, for diction is greatly influenced by factors 
such as occupation, socio-economic views, cultural 
upbringings, and in the spatiotemporal sense, the context. 

The argument is first discussed in the light of a third-party 
observer to the participants of an argument. The role of a 
third-party observer is not assigned to a constant agent. 
Third-party observers can play the role of participants to 
an argument, and vice-versa. Inclusion of third parties may 
be interpreted as being extraneous to the focus of the argument.
However, the description of a certain kind of argument requires 
acknowledgment of their existence by their relevance in judgments 
concerning the argument. The participants of an argument, split 
between at least two sides, are not expected to come to terms 
with what is the "correct" solution of the argument. This 
expectation does not rely on the matters of the argument to 
be subjective or objective in detail. Participants have the 
power to reject the building blocks of their competitors' 
arguments, as to not receive these arguments' main points, 
such as conclusions and conjectures, to be valid. On the 
viability of continuing the argument as a forward force 
against the power of the opposing participant's rejection, 
the solution for standing by the argument would turn into 
solving for an energy resource and expenditure issue, instead 
of the truthfulness of the argument in the local,global, and 
agent-relational contexts. More than one descriptor certainly 
exists to categorize this kind of argument. A fair one would 
be <ins>interpretable argument</ins>, an argument that values 
the interpretation/s on a grander scale than the truthfulness 
of whatever leanings and points in formulations the participants 
may present. 

In a first demonstration of the <ins>interpretable argument</ins>, 
there are two participants $p_1$, $p_2$, and a third-party 
observer $O$ in an argument on the matter $M$, 

$$M=[0,1,2, \\ 
a,b,c, \\ 
4,5,6, \\ 
d,e,f].$$

Participant $p_1$ decides that $M$ is supposed to mean  
$N = [[0,a,4,d],[1,b,5,e],[2,c,6,f]]$,  
and $p_2$ decides that it is  
$R = [[0,b,5],[1,a,4,f,6],[2,c,d,e]]$  
for a posed issue $I$. Both the participants used the 
same constituents in their arguments, and each of them 
believes that they are the one with the correct argument 
in the argument between them. Observer $O$ has the administrative 
privilege of ending the argument by selecting one of $p_1$ 
or $p_2$ with the better argument, by the stipulation of 
consequences to be inflicted on the participant that continues 
the argument after the declaration of the winner. This case 
produces a stop to the argument between $p_1$ and $p_2$ because 
$O$ had decided, before presiding over the argument, that 
the argument cannot go longer for a finite amount of time 
set by them. Without there being an observer $O$ with 
control privileges of the argument, $p_1$ and $p_2$ would 
continue to argue for their own interpretations of matter 
$M$. Their arguments are combinative/permutative 
reformattings of $M$, unique to one another. Each of them 
formulated their interpretation according to their own 
processes of standards and chosen calculations. Participant 
$p_1$ claims that $b$ and $5$ cannot be grouped with $0$, 
so $p_2$'s argument is baseless by $p_1$'s judgment. 
In a similar vein, $p_2$ claims that $p_1$'s argument $N$ 
lacks logical correctness because of a few errors. By $p_2$'s 
judgment, constituent $2$ and $6$ should ideally not be 
together. So that is already a deduction in $N$'s credibility 
by its stylistic choice. Also, $p_2$ claims constituent $f$ 
cannot be grouped with $c$, and that is an immediate grounds 
for the incorrectness of argument $N$. There are two areas 
of projectability in this argument with three agents. In the 
first area, the matter $M$ is projectable because it is 
interpretable: each of the argument's participants projects 
a separate image from an identical source. In the other area, 
both of the interpretations, $N$ and $R$, are projectable. 
Observer $O$ determines that one or the other is the better 
solution, the categories of better and not projections from the 
participants' interpretations. 

*note:* This text uses the "argument" to describe a topic 
that two or more participants argue on. Each of the participants 
have an argument that perpetuates something in this argument. 
Their arguments are sub-arguments of the argument they partake 
in. 

The interpretable argument can also take place without an 
observer. In some of these situations, the participants of 
their formulated arguments have the autonomy to agree or 
disagree on the correctness of the solution, and to proceed 
forward from that degree of compatibility. Other situations 
place different conditions on the participants. A participant 
may lose the equal hand in their argument against the other/s. 
This participant's argument may then be placed in the domain 
controlled by the other participant/s, due to this inequality. 
The other participant/s, in turn, have the capability to 
depict the argument of this participant as something else, 
a non-identical retelling. Depending on the gravity of the 
topic of argument, the participant that has their argument 
lose the status of equal hand could find themselves at a 
great disadvantage, based on the operable potential of 
action from the argument that they participated in, amongst 
the other participants. The other participants could adversely 
depict this participant to non-participants (third-party 
observers), and leverage negative reception back against 
this participant. The non-participants could influence 
factors unrelated to the argument but somehow impactful to 
the existence of the participant that has lost the equal 
hand. In this situation, there is a malicious triangulation 
with the participant of argument's unequal status placed 
as the "sink" for losses. 

![image info](./images/aipc_one.PNG)

**AIPC1:** Other participants $P_O$ are able able to assert 
control over $P$ and its argument (black dot), by $F_{control}$ 
for containment. $P_O$ depicts $P$ in an adversarial light 
to observers $OBS$, who then penalize $P$ with function $F_{penalize}$. 

A more qualitative exploration of the argument in its 
context demands categories for usage of the argument's 
constituents. Boolean labels for the truthfulness of each 
constituent serve as a barebones basic. There is the spectrum 
of continuity that is used in cases of uncertainty between 
polarities. The category of external mutability, according to 
state and behavioral conservation, adds another dimension 
of complexity. Overall, the use of both of these categories 
works in a manner similar to that of the complex number 
system. To allow for explanation that concentrates on the 
coverage of the quality over the potential messiness in 
quantitative demonstration, boolean labels are preferred over 
their infinitely-sized counterparts, the spectrum. A step 
further from the labeling akin to that of the complex numerical 
system, two more categories are used, the boolean of the 
truth's effects onto the self and that from the other. 
So there are 16 possibilities, $2^4$, for four boolean 
categories. 

The finitely-sized rubric is used as a methodology of 
judgment by one of the agents concerning the argument. 
This finite rubric is also a full boolean map; every 
constituent from the argument as input produces a boolean. 
In arguments of free form (not elaborated on), a thoroughly 
comprehensive rubric is not as simple in definition as this 
one described. There are troubling issues with any finitely-sized 
rubric, but these issues are better isolated for understanding 
in comparison with the matters concerning free forms. A 
recurring issue is the effectuality of the rubric, based 
on an arbitrary issue. The issue could be a matter of pure 
preference outside of the scope of nature-based systems. 
In natured-based systems, a rubric that is valid would have 
to accomodate for these natural laws. Design and verification 
of rubrics observe these natural laws that take precedence 
over the accomodation of preferences by autonomous agents. 

A rubric is always associated with an objective, an agenda 
in other words, that acts on the knowledge gained from the 
rubric's use. The objective contains prescribed actions to 
be taken for the possibilities of the information gathered 
from the rubric. This is a prescribed tool distributed to 
users for them to comprehend the qualities, perhaps by 
the use of quantities, of a matter with qualities unknown 
or unrecorded to them before they engage on analysis by 
the rubric. The qualities that a rubric observes and the 
objective from the rubric are not bound by traits contained 
entirely between them two, due to the obvious condition 
that autonomous agents are involved in at least one step 
concerning the use of the rubric. And they, the agents, 
have or derive objectives out of their own understanding 
of pressing needs to be satisfied. The rubric is also 
thought of as an auxiliary tool of filtration for a control 
system to produce and maintain a controlled environment borne 
from controlled outcomes. The aims of a rubric are wholly 
considered in this next diagram's elaboration. 

Using the four-category labeling system put forth, an example 
of an argument is initiated with two missing labels for its 
constituents in the categories of the truth's effects onto 
the argument's possessor and effects from the other. These 
two missing labels of an argument are due to its existing in 
a lone state, with no influences from participants of an 
argument or any rubric/s. Back to the mention of nature-based 
systems, assume for intents and purposes of their effects 
on the rubric, natural laws are immutable by any 
participant of any argument, although immutable traits 
do not guarantee constancy of those traits' effects. A 
rubric has a number of specific natural laws, probably not 
all of them, pertinent to it in its context of use. A user 
of a rubric in use may be able to control all of the 
natural laws pertaining to it. In these cases, the two 
constituent labels on the argument's effects directly 
correspond to the exclusive relations between the rubric's 
users. The category of an argument's mutability is also 
complicated, in its lone state. If the label for 
mutability of an argument in its lone state is known, 
knowledge of this is expected before the argument's 
engagement with forces not of the argument's possessor. 
The possessor's knowledge of this label also presumes them 
to be aware of what constituents in their argument are not 
guaranteed to conserve their form in their practical existence. 
To clarify, however, the four labels of this kind of argument 
defined do not require accurate knowledge of them by any 
of the argument's participants, including the possessor.

**AIPC2:** A diagram showing the four-category model of an 
argument's constituent. The constituent $C$, when put through 
decomposition, produces the labels that are the red and orange 
nodes. The relation between the rubric $R$ and pertaining natural 
laws $N_{laws}^{(p)}$ are of question. Both $R$ and $N_{laws}^{(p)}$ 
play roles of arbitrary degree to one another in producing the 
function $F_{inf}$. The function $F_{inf}$ determines the 
influence of its producer on the constituent, based on the 
constituent's truth value $v_t$ and the mutability of $v_t$, as 
$v_{t}^{(m)}$, to produce values on the two categories of effects 
(red nodes). Clockwise demarcation from $F_{inf}$ symbolizes 
the virtually absolutist connection it has on its products, the 
effects. 

The diagram below is an abstraction of the argument and the 
participants. 

![image info](./images/aipc_three.PNG)

**AIPC3:** A topic $T$ with an issue $I$. The issue produces 
an argument $A$ between $n$ participants. Each of the participants 
poses their unique argument as the correct argument for the matter 
that is the issue $I$.

![image info](./images/aipc_four.PNG)

**AIPC4:** An argument as the rectangle holding five constituents. 
These five constituents are expressed as a sequential flow, by the 
red arrows. The dashed green lines from each constituent are part 
of their "strong" implications, the underlying reasoning that each 
constituent relies on as a basis for validation. The dashed blue 
arrows emitting from the argument are "weak" implications, defined 
in this use as the meanings from the constituents of the argument 
that are deduced without an achievement of certainty. 

Diagram AIPC4 is of the <ins>continuous argument</ins> 
classification. The continuous argument is expressed as a 
sequential flow of its constituents, uninterrupted from the first 
constituent to the last constituent. Continuous arguments do not have 
to be interminable, despite their naming. Arguments that solely use the 
four-category constituent model have <ins>immutable initial expression</ins>; 
the possessor of the argument cannot permute, obsfuscate, or alter 
any of the constituents. The possessor could play a role in the 
effects of each constituent. In <ins>discontinuous arguments</ins>, 
each participant in an argument makes exchanges, usually of a 
communicative form, with one another. An exchange of one 
participant could be reactive to another one, and this same 
exchange could also not be part of the focus for the participant's 
crux of their argument. The discontinous argument starts off with 
a statement, then allows for ensuing exchanges of a potentially reactive 
form to the constituents of another participant's argument. The 
starting statement and these exchanges make up the body of each 
participant's discontinuous argument. A participant could also 
produce constituents, in their argument's progress, that "retract" 
or "reverse" the meaning of a previous constituent. Retractions 
and reversals are also found in some continuous arguments, but 
their effectiveness as an integrating force for these arguments' 
assertions and/or conclusions is questionable by analysis of 
these arguments' selves. Due to the elevation of doubt as an 
effect, at least in the cognitive sense, of retractions and 
reversals, these two techniques are seldom used in continuous 
arguments of a straightforward force, in its style of expression, 
with aims to provide more direct interpretation for a wanted reaction 
of an arbitrary will. Overall,discontinuous arguments are more 
extensive in generalization because their constituents do not 
depend on sequential paths of expression. Constituents of a 
reactive kind are connected as counterparts to the constituents 
of other participants' discontinuous arguments. And so, the 
understanding of their sources from which they are generated 
from is dependent on the knowledge and understanding 
of their counterparts. 

On the category of constituent mutability by an external force, 
$v_t^{(m)}$, in the boolean space of sixteen possibilities for 
the four-category model,  

$$apply(v_t^{(m)} \equiv true) \Longrightarrow (v_t \mathrel{*}=-1) \\ 
\rightarrow \Delta_{?}^{F_{inf}}(e_s,e_o).$$  

If a constituent is mutable, an external force that applies itself 
onto the constituent would output the opposite of the current truth 
value $v_t$. The change of $v_t$ may result in changes onto the effects 
of $C$, based on the influencer $F_{inf}$. The rest of this section 
focuses on the continuous argument as a body of meaning that an 
adversarial agent, either a participant not the possessor of the 
argument or a third-party observer, acts against to effect its 
change in these three primary routes: 
- depiction of the argument to an agent that is 
  not its possessor,
- execution of the argument in the expressing of its 
  sequentially-ordered constituents, 
- argument nullification.

The effects of the four-category boolean constituent, as 
$(e_s,e_o)$, such that 1 denotes a positive effect and -1 
a negative effect, are ranked as preference for the possessor 
of the argument's constituents in this descending order:  
$(1,-1),(1,1),(-1,-1),(-1,1).$  

This particular ordering is for the possessor's desired gains 
of the effects with consideration for the gains of possibly negative 
value distributed to the other, such that the possessor prioritizes 
their comparative gains over the other to "win" by establishing a 
positive gap in value between themself, based on the 
constituent's effect on themself, and the other by the constituent's 
effect on them. 

The adversarial agent $P_A$ engages in a campaign of outcome 
engineering to influence the depiction of an adversary $B$'s 
argument $A_b$. Recall that initially, $A_b$ is immutably expressed 
by $B$. $B$ intends for this initial expression as the one form of 
$A_b$ to be received by other participants and third-party observers. 
In the outcome engineering campaign, $P_A$ focuses on the effects 
of $A_b$'s constituents. $P_A$ does not have the natural certainty 
of knowledge on these effects as they do with the truth values $v_t$ 
and those values' mutabilities $v_t^{(m)}$. A note on the side, these 
mutability values are typically known through trial-and-error. $P_A$ 
would first hypothesize what the influencer function $F_{inf}$ is 
for each of argument $B$'s constituents. Using the hypothesis of 
$F_{inf}$, $P_A$ hypothesizes what the effects of each constituent 
are, and these effect values are what $P_A$ bases their expectations 
on in their outcome engineering. For an argument of $n$ constituents, 
there are $q \leq 2^{2n}$ possible outcomes at most. From a numerical 
perspective, the adversary $P_A$'s objective is the greatest positive 
gap in effect value between themself and the possessor of the 
argument. In another perspective, each of the possible $q$ possible 
outcomes induces another effect/s, and one or some of these additional 
effects is what the adversary $B$ intends to engineer $A_b$ towards. 
This second perspective is used in long-running situations such 
that the immediate gains from the effects of the argument are not 
the sole concern for the adversary; the field of game theory has 
a special sub-field devoted to the study of infinitely-spanning 
games. 

The $q$ number of outcomes are correlated to the number of 
mutable constituents. The definition of the four-category 
constituent model does not require there to be any changes 
of effects from the switching of a mutable constituent's 
truth value. If there are $k$ mutable constituents, 
$0 \leq k \leq n$, then these constituents could produce 
$2^{2k}$ unique effects, at most. The adversarial agent 
$P_A$ attempts to apply change onto the mutable constituents 
of argument $B$, by some sequence of actions to produce 
a depiction to another agent. This depiction is to satisfy 
one of the two objectives mentioned in the ending of the 
previous paragraph. Whereas the argument $B$ is the image 
intended to be emitted by its possessor $A_b$, $P_A$ 
uses methodologies of outcome engineering to project $B$ 
as something other to the destination point/s. 

![image info](./images/aipc_five.PNG)

**AIPC5:** Agent $P_A$ engages in an outcome engineering 
campaign to produce a depiction of an argument $B$, possessed 
by $A_b$. Agent $P_A$'s intention is for the projected 
image, as $DEPICT(B)$, to be directed to another agent, 
the observer $O$, in order for that agent to view and 
comprehend $DEPICT(B)$ in the place of the actual $B$. 

An argument's execution requires additional attributes 
that are not considered in the previous overview on the 
argument's depiction. Depiction is conceptualized in this 
section as a "solid state" image, projected by an agent 
that uses an argument as the initial image. Execution 
has properties that rely on temporal matters. Through 
a temporal span, execution expresses different images 
through this passage. In terms of an argument, these 
different images are due to the shifting through of 
constituents. The steps in such sequential processes 
cannot produce an achievement of some sorts, when based 
only in terms of their independent strengths. Each step's 
innate effectiveness in solving for a demand and the 
degree of attempt in it are not the only factors. The 
execution's steps are dependent on each other, and the 
outcome from the execution is what is from the convergence 
of all of the actions taken for these steps. By these 
properties of an execution, an argument must be thought 
of as a "fluid state" image. In the argument of a "fluid 
state", what is expressed to an agent at one point in time 
is not explicit in appearance to that same agent at another 
point in time, but that what is previously expressed carries 
relevance in forms that include base support,reference, and 
elimination of unrelated implications to an expression at 
a later point in time. 

![image info](./images/aipc_tab1.PNG)

**AIPCDEP:** An argument as eight constituents. At every 
point in time, the expressed constituents are not those 
expressed at a previous point in time. The constituents 
at every timestamp are dependent on previously expressed 
constituents, in order to be properly expressed. The 
expression of the argument ends after five timestamps.

The dependencies of each expressed constituent in table 
AIPCDEP are exclusively <ins>backward dependencies</ins>. 
Of course, depiction is depiction and execution is execution. 
An argument is not necessarily put in the permanent role 
of a "solid state" or a "fluid state" image. For instance, 
an adversarial agent can depict an argument $B$ as the 
"solid state" $B_1$ to an observer $O$. When $O$ receives 
$B_1$, the expression of $B_1$ is executed in a manner akin 
to "fluid state". 

An adversarial agent $P_A$, in its attempt to affect the 
execution of an argument for the possessor's loss in other 
terms, has an objective that may not be methodologically 
identical with that in engineering outcome with respect to 
a depiction. A re-design of the $apply$ function, used in 
depiction, is needed to accomodate this "fluid state". 
Recall that this $apply$ function produces outcomes of 
change onto the constituent's own labels $v_t,e_s$, 
and $e_o$. The possible dependencies shared between constituents 
of an executing argument's "fluid state" mean that applying 
a change onto a mutable constituent could inadvertently 
change the truth values, and thus the effects, or exclusively 
the effects of another constituent. These kinds of changes 
entertained are found in complex cases of sequential bodies 
with dependent constituents, for they require many more 
calculations than more basic forms of change. And these 
additional calculations carry with them non-negligible 
measures of uncertainty on their accuracy. In a basic form 
of change that comes from changing a mutable constituent 
in a dependent relation, the truth value of the dependent 
constituent also changes, reversed in boolean settings. 
In another basic form, the dependent constituent is "negated", 
subtracted from the argument's whole, by its dependency's 
change. Argument nullification, the last of the primary 
routes of change, could be accomplished by this negation 
process. 

To summarize on the practices of an adversarial agent against 
an argument, this being the forward force as mentioned in 
the beginning of this section, the adversarial agent employs 
tactics that fall under the umbrella of outcome engineering. 
In argument nullification, the agent has the absolutist 
objective of "negating" or "neutralizing" all constituents 
of the argument so that the argument does not have any essence 
of reason or value for continuing its existence. For effecting 
change onto an executable argument, the constituents of the 
argument that serve as the greatest source of dependency for 
other constituents' dependencies are the ones with the greatest 
attraction for an adversarial agent's attempts to modify by outcome 
engineering, especially if those constituents are mutable. 

## Proprietary Calculations <a name="p19"></a>

The title is from and for treachery, at least in part, is it 
not? Cold, schematic, manipulative due to the knowledge of 
calculating and the choice-ability of calculation. A dark
personality trait, some of them say, out of their self-professed 
desires to "spread the truth", to "bring order and equity" into 
the mix that is at risk of becoming spoiled. Privatized, 
cryptographic, gravitating inwards towards the center to be 
kept dark. These attributes do not appear conducive towards 
an open-armed embrace devoid of naivety. The expressive and 
outspoken decide it is their turn to chime in: "there must be a 
better way; there has to be a more effective way to involve 
more external sources of input, for a better world, one step, 
one day, one improvement at a time." 

Open frameworks. Open-source frameworks. That has been a 
prevailing solution proposed to maintain a transparency over 
matters of pertinence. Open frameworks allow for every 
participant to learn and understand the rules, the procedures, 
and all the mechanisms used to produce auxiliary tools for 
use in these frameworks. Manuals are provided for these 
frameworks. Users of the frameworks study these manuals 
to understand the intricacies of the frameworks. Before a 
user enters into the realm of using the framework, they are 
expected to have perfect information on the details of the 
framework. There is an openness in these frameworks. By 
choosing to be a member of the framework, users can expect 
to be more aware of their co-user's utilities in calculations. 

If this much can be stated on open frameworks, what 
guarantees would open frameworks bring to prospective 
users? A few vantage points are to be looked at for bases 
to be formulated on what protections and opportunities open 
frameworks offer if adopted, especially if these frameworks 
enable proprietary calculations. This class of calculations 
is given this name due to attributes on its procedural 
generators and its outputs that are reserved for an 
exclusive group of entities. Whatever values of worth and 
ramifications from these calculations can only be assumed 
to place a reserved class of entities over others, on the 
condition that all there is to a chain-of-command and other 
structures that are less hierarchical, more uniform in 
distribution of resources and capabilities with few outliers 
in the properties of effectual actions, are the functions 
and the calculations, one and the same, without anything 
else outside of the effectual confines of the calculation 
infrastructure. 

Use the arithmetic system as an example of an open framework. 
Arithmetic, a rudimentary usage of numbers in an input-output 
format, does work for fair and equal purposes. Every participant
in the open framework of arithmetic has the liberty to use 
whatever operators and operands they set their selection to. 
These same participants can also decide what outputs they 
favor the most, and then to select the appropriate operators 
and operands to satisfy this favoritism. When there are 
restrictions on specific operators, or on specific ranges of 
values for input and output values, equally placed on all 
participants, then each participant has to play by these rules.
Of predispositions unfortunate or not, each participant is 
assigned different starting numbers from others, by which 
to perform arithmetic on. Given what restrictions of operators 
and numerical ranges placed equally on them, each participant 
has a relatively fair opportunity of reaching any number 
reached by any other. A participant that cannot reach a number 
that another participant can reach is still left with their 
own numbers, so a rationale for fairness can still be made 
in these cases. 

Does the description of open framework as an infrastructure 
allow for participants to freely use the open framework? 
By a consequentialist linearity in participant activity, 
the answer is a resounding NO from the self-interested. 
The open framework of arithmetic, with numbers of properties 
each suited to the demands of differing contexts, in an 
environment that is resource-dependent, through inputs and 
outputs producing effects outside of the use of the number, 
does not suffice in guarantees for a participant intent on 
spending for their wanted numbers of input for outputs with 
effects that they intend to "benefit" from. The free use of 
the open framework is not such from the start, the use of 
the framework, to the finish, the effects that are desired. 
This perspective does define "free use" to be from these 
checkpoints of start and finished. To define the use of the 
open framework as free when all participants are subject 
to the same rules and each participant has equal access 
to the input controllers does produce a misconception that 
can only be unlearned through the errors of the trial. 
To add more technicality to the mix, if each participant 
is subject to the same rules of the open framework, but 
some of them are additionally subject to differing mechanisms 
of capacities and qualities, then there is already the 
question of how far free use really goes. Maybe it is not 
the breadth and depths of the effects from free use that 
need to be kept at an equal level. So free use may 
be defined as the arbitrary use of an open framework with 
rules equally placed on its participants. But that phrase 
of "free use" does not shed light on the guarantees. Perhaps 
that is the point of an "open framework" for "open-ended 
effects". At least every participant would be able to 
understand the rules right down to the specificities for 
the system that is open and deserved to them. Every entity 
could voluntarily participate in these open frameworks. 
However else can paradise be reached? 

Despite the doubts on open frameworks leading to an 
equality through greater access to prospective participants, 
there is one trait on them that is more certain in truth. 
The open framework starts off as a private body of mechanisms, 
developed by a few to be used by a few. Through the demands 
posed by temporal progression, private frameworks become more 
known by those outside of the origin. The rules and procedures 
of the private framework are valued in some way by them, and 
then there are calls of an exponential growth for these kinds 
of frameworks to become more accessible. Factors behind 
these calls include over-competition, that is, leveraging 
of power and advantage concentrated into efforts for the 
objective of victory, with these victories entailing 
severely lopsided gains and losses in zero-sum contexts. 
Open frameworks are a result of progressively greater 
demands. What was once a framework of rules and 
procedures reserved for a few has yielded enough long-lasting 
value for the framework to become an open instead of a 
closed one. If the value from these private frameworks has 
rised to above a point such that keeping the frameworks 
closed is a task to preserve an obsolete way of operation, 
then there is that as a reason for the framework to become 
an open one. So open frameworks are a progressive 
improvement indicative of demands different from that at 
the origin of the frameworks. These different demands 
therefore pose other rules and procedures as operation that 
form a new kind of private framework reliant on the 
previous framework, now open, to be directed in use for 
it. 

The mentioned generalization of the open framework 
transitioned from a closed one, as a decision from 
collective interests of an evolutionary system, still 
does not tell many details on the categories of 
calculations that play important parts in calculating 
systems. Is the open framework anything more than a 
"staging grounds" for what is designated proprietary 
in a self-improving process that reveals every last 
stage it experienced as open frameworks and conceals 
its current stage? The answer of a solid YES or NO 
still does not fulfill the adequacy for a "fair 
system", defined as inputs and outputs of qualities 
agreed upon by all, not merely the voluntary participants.
Open frameworks cannot be expected to produce universally 
agreed-upon predeterministic courses of action. For this 
posit, explanations in this section may be scant, but 
the autonomous nature of sentience does not really 
require any noteworthy explanation, always falling short 
due to incompleteness, when exemplifications from the 
image and the real course (of decisions taken or not, 
depictions concocted to be believed or not) serve as 
counter-arguments to the open framework as an automatic 
and enabling conduit for fairness and equity. Determinism 
is contentious, then, for the believers and non-believers. 

Of foremost pertinence in open frameworks is their usage. 
Suppose that initially, things really are fair and 
accessible. Every participant that joins in the utilities 
of the open framework are given evenly-distributed knowledge 
on how the framework works. These participants are also 
each granted the same external resources, in breadth and 
depth, as one another. Then, the styles of possibly 
differing appearance that produce possibly differing 
outcomes is put under inspection. Here is where 
the styles of use manifest themselves to produce spans 
of diverse outcomes, safe to assume to be infinitely-sized, 
at least from the beginning. Consider a layered computational 
model, with a low-level that is responsible for the most 
minute details in utilizing the most basic and individually 
inconsequential elements, all the way up to the highest 
high-level, a level that produces the last action (typically 
expressed in ways measurable by autonomous agents) in a 
directed flow of activity from the model projected outwards. 
And this last action is where the capability of full control 
over activity ends, since the effects of desired and 
actual do not have to be in total alignment. 

The user that heavily uses a layered computational 
model's lowest level will tend to have a more astute 
understanding of the fundamentals belonging to said model. 
This same user also does not emphasize the outward expression 
of the model, for this focus is reserved for those that are at 
the model's higher levels. Users of a layered computational 
model, specifically one of an open framework, that strongly 
prefer one end of the layer over the other, such as preference 
for the low-level over the high-level, will be of different 
qualities in thought and action compared with each 
other. The low-level user has an appreciation for the 
details of the layered computational model; their actions 
in this model do directly touch the model's underpinnings. 
And the high-level user, however much they may value the 
underlying mechanics and other minutiae of the model, is 
forced to gear their use for the outward expression of the 
model. If these high-level users are also coincidentally 
the representatives of the model, the ones responsible 
for the effects emanating from the model, then they 
are naturally forced to be more concerned about the 
effects of their actions from the model. 

Important sub-topics, in this conceptualization of the 
open framework as a layered computational model, are the 
sources of influence and the bearers of responsibility. 
A layered computational model with dynamic functionality 
also tends to be one of high plasticity, so that demands 
of morphological characteristic can be fulfilled. In a 
unidirectional flow from the lowest level to the highest 
level, the influence of effects from the model would be 
from the lowest level. Despite whatever level of non-deterministic 
output from the model that is an open framework, there would 
be no output without the lowest level. This statement does 
assume that there are necessitated co-dependencies shared 
between all layers of the model, in order for the model to 
output. In certain subtypes of models, the lowest levels 
do not have the autonomy to be modified, by themselves or 
through sources other than a few select prescribers (i.e. 
the higher levels). The higher levels could additionally 
attempt to make these lower levels fixed in their qualities, 
or to plan for rapid replacement of lower levels at risk 
of severence from the layered computational model. For 
these cases, the magnitude of influence higher levels carry 
over lower levels is multiple times greater than one. The 
term "responsibility" is now taken to mean the bearers of 
effects. The open framework and the administration of effects 
related to it are not rigidly connected without the involvement 
of autonomous agents, with their own way of handling matters 
that may be outside the completely controlling grasp of 
the open framework or the open framework's preferential usage.
The open framework, as a layered computational model, must 
be one with roles and procedures specially prescribed, 
possibly modified throughout the course of use, with 
certain levels of uniqueness to each layer. It is 
asymmetrical labor, in the form of hierarchies and 
stratifications, that adopt the open framework for use. 
The low-levels and high-levels of an open framework, in 
the form of a layered computational model, are conflated 
with this mentioned asymmetrical labor. 

Something called the <ins>precision curse</ins> is fit to 
be placed into the paradigm of the open framework. The 
precision curse is truly nothing new, but an aspect found 
in the failures of applied mathematics, although the failures 
do serve as a fuel for greater scientific rigor, and in 
social arrangements with declared ideals unable to be attained. 
These social arrangements, if have acquired enough prestige of 
proliferation in retelling, do result in literary works 
prominent in the categories of tragedy, superstition & lore, 
as well as political intrigue. The precision curse is found 
in two main areas, overlapping in some ways, of open 
frameworks: the layered computational model and information 
acquisition & utility. 

The building blocks of calculations between each layer of 
a layered computational model has already been mentioned 
as comparative differences. Consider a problem that has a 
relatively low probability of being solved by these models. 
This low rate is demonstrated through repeated iterations 
of their performance. After a user has fiddled enough with 
the parameters of each layer in the model, and to no avail 
of improvement, the user decides to accept the shortcomings 
as a permanence. After the user secures the lower levels 
into an effect-conserving state, they then only need to focus 
on operating the open framework at the highest high-level 
that they can be positioned at. At this point in the user's 
role with regards to the open framework, the user is expected 
to produce amounts of error quite measurable to other participants 
and the possible recipients. There are no ways around these 
errors in accordance with the user's style. The user is set 
on this way of using the open framework. Without regulatory 
overhead that is prohibitionist to the user, the user cannot 
be expected to cease except out of their own will. Under the 
prevailing chokehold of the precision curse, a user of a 
layered computational model may attempt to change the underlying 
mechanisms, found at the lower levels, for improved output. 
But the user will discover that this requires an extremely 
expensive magnitude of introspection into the device that they 
use, the device that is supposed to serve their aims, not their 
lofty estimations that remain correct only in the realm of 
imagination. And introspections of this nature need to be done 
frequently for problems that improve against the successes of 
the user. In this example of a contraption for erroneous 
offspring, metaphorically speaking, there is also the related 
concept of the <ins>pragmatism trap</ins> (section The 
Sophisticated as Behavior After Appearance). 

The economy of knowledge has its values and priorities. With 
open frameworks alongside select use and distribution of 
knowledge, a lack of expectations is the default 
anticipatory state for those avoidant of speculation. 
Unrestrained speculation for things not of a certainty 
is not of the diligent's decorum. Even for a thoroughly 
enjoyable future planned with no room for error, these 
futures typically constrained to a small and controlled 
environment, the meek dare not express their giddiness 
for fear that such giddiness can be spun around to ruin 
the dear event. A topic as grand in exemplified monetary 
value and as deep, insightful, and thoughtful as the economy 
of knowledge requires so many words, of textbooks and beyond, 
to be given due justice in the representation of the power in 
its gravity. In one of the more obvious routes to discuss 
the economy of knowledge, the factor of pre-emptive knowledge, 
possessed by one or more about others, is at the cornerstone 
of <ins>feedforward systems</ins>. Feedforward, the idea that 
one can use knowledge, supposedly accurate to the future, 
by appropriately planning for the outcomes of expected 
and desired, does become a concern. If determinism is something 
entirely reserved in the connected wills of all autonomous agents, 
then strategies of feedforwarding constitute one of the greatest 
essences in the outcomes of determinism, by pre-deterministically 
playing things at least one step ahead. 

The dynamism of information valuable to arbitrary contexts is 
broad enough for feedforwarding to also be of a similar magnitude 
in broadness of exemplification. Proceeding illustrations of 
feedforwarding are a part of the precision curse's information 
acquisition & utility. One important sub-class of feedforwarding 
is external multi-agent activity. 

![image info](./images/pc_one.PNG)

**PC1:** Variables $t_?$ denote the timestamp that the action 
from the source node to the end node took place. Agent $X_1$, 
as the blue node connected to their background information 
represented as the black box, takes the course of action 
that is the red nodes. This course of action was constructed 
by an external agent $Y_1$. The external agent first accesses 
the background information. Then $Y_1$ uses the environmental 
output-function $Y_2$ to produce the next step, as $X_2$, 
that $X_1$ takes. The information on the activity of $X_1$ 
in $X_2$ is given as feedback to agent $Y_1$. The external 
agent uses it, along with the background information, to 
generate the next environmental output-function $Y_3$. $Y_3$ 
then outputs the next step, $X_3$, for $X_1$. The process 
continues in this manner so as to produce a control mechanism 
of environment for wanted activity belonging to agent $X_1$.

Diagram PC1 shows <ins>externally-sourced feedforwarding 
environmental construction</ins>. Without discussing the 
two extreme possibilities in the aims of the external agent 
to the subject of such construction, there is this obvious 
fact worthy of mention: the external agent is able to exert 
a noticeable form of "control" over the recipient of their 
feedforwarding strategy. 

Another feedforwarding strategy is not as direct in 
assertion as that found in diagram PC1. But it is still 
prominent enough by its effects to have an example concocted 
for it. 

![image info](./images/pc_two.PNG)

**PC2:** Agent $X_0$ wants to take the path, represented 
by the blue nodes. At $X_1$, influencer agent $Y_0$ calls 
for influencer function $I_0$ to influence $X_0$'s course 
through a function $J_{noise}$ (stands for <ins>jitter-noise</ins>). 
At every diverted location $X_0$ is on, $X_0$ attempts to 
correct themself, by their wanted decision $W_{?}$ to $X_{?}$ for 
their intended route. Note the $J_{noise}$ functions connected 
to influencer $Y_0$. Each connection is bi-directional, allowing 
for the influencer to know when $X_0$ has traveled to the 
connection's corresponding node, and also where $X_0$ intends 
to go. 

Diagram PC2 is the strategy of <ins>externally-sourced 
feedforwarding influence</ins>. This is exemplar of granting 
the recipient an <ins>illusion of choice</ins>; the external 
agent $Y_0$ does not have to expend for the objective of 
constructing the environment for the recipient of their 
feedforwarding strategy. Influence, in the more covert approaches, 
is not outstanding in perception. The illustration of diagram PC2 
uses an intangible function called the jitter-noise, a diversionary 
effector onto those connected. 

External multi-agent activity is perhaps the most common 
future for open frameworks. This is not to state that 
involvement of numerous sources of input can result in 
outcomes differing between the expected and actual, but 
probabilities in forecasting do become modified, and 
these modifications affect the perception of the present, 
the present with emerging open frameworks. Frameworks 
that have been converted from proprietary to open states 
typically entail <ins>vulnerability transfers</ins> in 
zero-sum agenda. The agenda does not have to be zero-sum, 
sure, but that is a design best left to the finiteness 
of resources, the owners of those resources, and those 
desiring to own those resources. In proprietary frameworks 
with possessors that reap benefit from them, the possessors 
do so at marked cost to non-possessors. The possessors could 
go on ahead to deploying these kinds of frameworks directly 
against non-possessors in competitive match-ups, with strong 
lines of distinction in activity and possibly status between 
them and their competitors, the non-possessors. The possessors 
could also bypass the non-possessor's control of input and 
cooperation that they would have had to be bound by if not 
for their proprietary framework/s. One area that open frameworks 
operate in, as a critical effector variable, is <ins>confidence 
building</ins>. A valuable proprietary framework somehow became 
valuable enough for there to be a belief that its exclusive 
possession is a vulnerability. The possessors have to 
fortify defensive mechanisms to guard their "secret", 
and the non-possessors feel as though they are put on 
an unfair playing field, the set-up intended not by them 
for their failures costless to adversaries. When the 
proprietary framework is relinquished to the level of 
an open one, the vulnerability in unfair mechanisms 
through usage may still remain at some point in the 
chain of activity related to the framework. The framework 
is now less exclusive, and the question of its possession 
is no longer entirely under the umbrella of vulnerabilities. 
A typical goal of the framework becoming open is to 
enable confidence between users to foster, for those outside 
of the conventional realms of usage to become familiarized 
with it and for independent verification. The open framework 
becomes subject to the ever-vigilant scrutiny of judges, 
specialized or not, in their inspection of its correctness 
and consistency. With passing marks on verification tests, 
more transparent than proprietary's self-verifying skew in 
nature, confidence flourishes for the framework's validity, 
now open. 

In zero-sum contexts, the bulk of vulnerabilities is transferred 
over to the open framework's usage. Some elaboration on 
how this transferal plays out has already been made in this 
section. In perpetuating proprietary measures, these ones 
stacked on top of the open framework, adopters exclusively 
select peers to cooperatively build confidence, exclusive between 
them, by sharing risks in actions taken. These risks involve building 
proprietary measures on top of the open framework, all the 
while avoiding or suppressing opposition that hampers this building, 
to achieve the promised value of obtaining a surefire advantage 
amongst the framework's mass use. This situation is another pillar 
in supporting the argument that open frameworks do serve as "staging 
grounds" for designs of styles and use not for the open. 

All autonomous entities engage in calculations that cannot be 
entirely left open in such a way as to be vulnerable outlets. This is 
a statement based on the derivatives borne from biological immune 
systems. Entities' proprietary calculations are a fixture 
due to their engineering of odds, once unfavorable or questionable, 
towards objectives of a more absolutist mark in effects. And 
obviously, absolutism is zero-sum. 

## The Audience Is the Vulture <a name="p20"></a> 

There is a division already, is there not? There is the audience 
and the spectated. To go ahead and assume that this division will 
foment a kind of malevolence between these two groups is too far 
without more details. The participants of a spectacle open to an 
audience could just be there, enjoying themselves in each others' 
company. Negativity aside, please. An absolute lack of cooperation 
and unity to state that there is a division that is not benign. 
Vultures are not inherently bad creatures, and what notoriety they 
garner is not because they are terrific predators. Quite opposite. 
The anatomy of the vulture makes them ill-suited to acting as 
predators in the ways of their more prestigious avian cousins. 
There are cognitive limits placed on the sentient life besides 
from human beings, which is why their anatomical design proves 
to be a great determinant in their potential of capabilities. 
This is not a flattering remark on humanity. It has been stated 
many times, and this time is simply a retelling: human beings 
compensate for physical inability through actionable cognitive 
ability. Emphasis on the descriptor "actionable". Maybe there 
are creatures on this planet more intelligent than the human. 
The vulture, although also not known to be beyond the intelligence 
of their peers, serves the noble purpose of an important mediator 
in the cycling of life,death, and decomposition. Decomposition, 
the last stage, is where the vulture intervenes as a clean-up 
technician. Possible biological hazards are removed through 
their feasting. Some nicknames for vultures: scavengers, bottom 
feeders. 

The audience is not always the vulture in settings where there 
are no mortal casualties. In the technical sense, the vulture 
as the audience is there to anticipate what it believes is 
inevitable to emerge out of the situation: death in material 
form. The vulture could also just so happen to stumble upon 
the material death. And then the creature is able to feast 
without there being resistance perceivable to it. Feast it 
does, joyfully and naturally, by its specialized digestive 
system that processes more extreme inputs than other 
counterparts. 

In this section, the reason for why the audience is likened 
to a vulture is to fulfill a healthy skepticism on matters 
such as duties, appeasement, impressionism, and honor. Each 
of these four mentioned terms is a <ins>single-minded promoter</ins>. 
Such drastic displays and actions taken, and there is little 
space or time in direly needy situations for there to be 
a reflection on the underlying reasoning that is usually 
strongly tainted with emotionalism. To merrily jump into 
harm's way is, by far, one of the most cliched tropes in 
tragedy. This is not ridicule on these deeds of autonomous 
will under the influence, but such risky actions are to be 
rationed because of their terminal and non-regeneratable 
outcomes. The vulture has evolved to be smart in other senses 
then. Not only a noble servant in the cycling of life,death, 
and decomposition, it is also calculating through aversion 
of risk. Its way of diet serves its appetite, the sanitation 
of the environment, and some may argue, the honorable 
relinquish of the dead from purgatory to the afterlife. 
And the vulture does not need to merrily jump into harm's 
way. That would violate its role in the cycle. Creatures 
such as vultures are fixed in their behavior. The audience 
is not. But some parallels of interest emerge when the 
audience is likened to the vulture. 

Section To Be Revered by What is related to the spectating 
vulture. In that previous section, the theme touches on the 
idea of that which is spectated to be believed as a source 
for worship. The computational reference network, especially, 
with an example diagram CRN2, could be used to depict how the 
spectators (references) view the spectated (source). Diagram 
CRN2 shows two references with material and functional utility 
transfers with the source. Reference $R_0$ acquires functional 
utility from the source and pays material utility to it. The 
relation is opposite to that of the other reference $R_1$. This 
computational reference network raises the question of what 
real immediate and long-term benefits these relations between 
the references and the source amount to. It is an open question. 
Entity $S$, of the title "source", is actually not by the 
section's definition of a computational reference network's 
source. $S$ would have to provide strictly one of material or 
functional utility to the references. Instead, $S$ has relations 
differing between the references $R_0$ and $R_1$. $S$ somehow 
manages to hold onto the title of "source" because they are a 
middle-agent between the two references. A great majority of 
the traffic flows through $S$, and this majority flow corresponds 
to a granting of greater control to $S$ if the matter of control 
is their choice for non-null magnitude.  

The vulture is a protector and a reaper. These two metaphors 
for the metaphor of the audience as a vulture spark curiosity 
in their coupling. By these terms' associations, the vulture 
is a gray-zone creature. In the singular theme of heroics, the 
vulture is an anti-hero. An ambiguous necessity for the greater 
order, proponents of the creature argue. The beginning of this 
work makes the claim that zero-sum is greatly emphasized in the 
education of decision-making. Specifically, the economic sub-field 
of game theory spearheads this as a co-existing dynamic with non-zero 
sum games. Some that engage in games of sorts, outside of pure 
recreation, can favor specific kinds of payoff for themselves. 
In terms of the psychological impact from a payoff's effects retained 
in memory, and the retention of the memory then used as fuel for 
self-corrective or self-improving mechanisms, the actualization of 
zero-sum dynamics arguably outsizes in impact when compared to 
cousin-types of payoffs. Depending on what is placed as the object 
or principle that is enumerated in the payoff table, the pain of 
unwanted forfeiture from zero-sum opens the route for a wide 
possible range of indentation on the losing recipient's modus 
operandi. The vulture, the gray-zone creature that it is, makes 
for a potent case study in the blurring of game theory payoff 
labels. 

The vulture, the spectator, not the spectated, exists in a 
few paradigms featuring it as the star of the show. Sentiments, 
usually not explicitly expressed, go something like this: 

"We the Vulture stand strong and together,  
To fight for what is rightfully ours,  
To voice both opinions and judgments,  
With no sound, wait in silence,  
Onto those fortunate or not to stand them,  
For our voice to reap what kills our hunger."  

The vulture loses its place as a direct metaphor for the 
audience through the passage of these numerous paradigms. 
Conditions and privileges, of an unnatural association to the 
literal creature that is the vulture, are attached to these 
conceptualizations. And these conditions and privileges are 
from human societies. 

Illustration of the vulture as something more than 
another run-of-the-mill creature starts with focus on it 
as the reaper. Payoff tables enable the quantifying 
definition of the vulture's context. This context of 
structurally allocated numbers enables viewers to 
predict, with odds of correctness tending to above fifty 
percent, what the vulture decides on. 

![image info](./images/taiv_one.PNG)

**TAIV1:** Two spectated agents $S_1$ and $S_2$ engaged 
in a duel. The payoff pair-values show a combination of 
zero-sum and non-zero sum two-combinations belonging 
to the spectated agents. Prediction of the most probable 
move a spectator $S_x$ takes, with respect to the move 
$q_?$ of adversary $S_y$, can be accomplished by 
following the Nash equilibrium. 

There is unclear frequency in move usage for each of the 
agents $S_1$ and $S_2$. For agent $S_1$, the move $q_5$ 
guarantees a zero-probability of them losing any value. 
Move $q_5$ is also agent $S_1$'s highest potential earner. 
Agent $S_2$ has a more difficult time with establishing 
an equilibrium for acting on its available moveset. The 
cumulative (gains,losses) for $S_2$'s moves $q_1,q_2$, 
and $q_3$ are $(9,-7)$, $(12,-15)$, and $(10,-15)$. The 
highest possible gain for each of these moves are $6,12$, 
and $10$, respectively. Due to the markedly greater possibility 
for $S_2$'s loss by moves $q_2$ and $q_3$, moves that pose 
a $\frac{2}{3}$ probability of transmitting loss to them, 
a risk-averse $S_2$ decides on the move $q_1$ as the most 
frequent action they take, in typical circumstances of 
$S_1$'s equal probabilities in their action. 

![image info](./images/taiv_two.PNG)

**TAIV2:** The same spectated agents from table TAIV1. 
For each combination of moves, there is a boolean for 
each agent. The boolean denotes if the respective agent 
is capable of acting on the move in the event that the 
opposing agent acts on their move. This table contains 
variable boolean values, subject to change by the causality 
of the specific spatiotemporal context during the duel. 

Table TAIV2 forms a layout of restrictions imposed on 
each of the agents during their duel. The agents would 
each have to be conscientious of what choices in moves 
they each can take at every changing context in their 
duel. Without these restrictions, agent $S_1$ could 
blindly choose move $q_5$ at every decision junction. 
And this simple selection would yield them a probable 
chance of beating the other agent. TAIV2 makes $S_1$'s 
affinity for selecting $q_5$ no longer guaranteed; 
there could be FALSE values in the table pertaining to 
$S_1$ and their move $q_5$. 

Tables TAIV1 and TAIV2 form the foundation of decisions 
for the spectated $S_1$ and $S_2$. In this setting, $S_1$ 
and $S_2$ are associated with positive defense points $P_1$ 
and $P_2$. These defense points are added to or subtracted 
from by the agent actions taken, and a defense point $P_?$ 
that falls to a non-positive value results in their owner's 
decisive loss. $S_1$ and $S_2$ are in this situation to each 
attempt to independently win. Despite the non-zero sum options 
available in table TAIV1, there is no termination of agent 
actions until at least one of them is downed. The possible 
equilibrium of both of the players gaining from a decision 
junction is slim at $\frac{2}{9}$. In rare occasions, table 
TAIV2 would restrict the other seven combinations of moves, 
thereby granting positive and non-zero sum gains for both 
agents. It is safe to assume in a duel that is non-restrictive 
on agent moveset, the situation of $S_1$ and $S_2$ is a non-zero 
sum terminal game. The categorization of this being non-zero sum 
is through process of elimination, by use of this condition: 
each decision junction would have to result in zero-sum changes 
to the game participants for the game to be labeled zero-sum. 

Meanwhile, the vulture is patiently waiting for the termination 
of the situation between $S_1$ and $S_2$.

**TAIV3:** A variable number of $n$ vultures are spectating 
the duel between $S_1$ and $S_2$. Depending on which of the 
agents $S_1,S_2$ are fallen, the vultures expect no negative 
changes to their well-being. Each $P^{(x)}_j$ value is a 
positive partition of gains for the specific $x$'th 
vulture in the advent of the $j$'th spectated falls. 

The vulture, in the situation between $S_1$ and $S_2$, is a 
zero-sum benefactor after the situation is terminated. The 
reason for this unequivocating claim is due to the strong 
<ins>division of labor</ins> present: the spectator does not 
need to inflict or receive damage, and the spectated are stuck 
in the situation until there is a non-recoverable loss from 
at least one of the ends. The vulture is not under scrutiny 
or threat of harm; its only stake as a non-acting participant 
in the situation is its independent energy usage for waiting 
time till termination. 

![image info](./images/taiv_four.PNG)

**TAIV4:** A differing alternative of the situation from 
table TAIV1. All move combinations are non-zero sum, and 
completely positive in gains for both agents $S_1$ and $S_2$. 

![image info](./images/taiv_five.PNG)

**TAIV5:** A differing alternative of the situation from 
table TAIV1. Each value of the cost table is a triplet 
showing the gains made by the vulture, $S_1$, and $S_2$. 
All move combinations are non-zero sum and completely 
positive in gains for both agents $S_1$ and $S_2$. For 
every move combination, the vulture loses the sum of the 
gains by $S_1$ and $S_2$. 

The situation in TAIV4 guarantees there to be no casualties 
of $S_1$ and/or $S_2$. Spectating vultures would lose their 
patience after having discovered the values of table TAIV4, 
and go elsewhere to scavenge. As for the situation of TAIV5, 
the vultures would discover, quite shortly after the duel 
between $S_1$ and $S_2$ has commenced, not to stay around in 
the vicinity for their own well-being of life. The vulture 
intends to remain a zero-sum reaper, out of its role-playing 
possibilities. 

A characteristic separate from the literal vulture is attached 
to the abstraction of a vulture in this next paradigm. Vultures, 
the indiscriminate consumer of the material dead, turn out to 
have a favoristist slant to their spectatorship. Favoritism 
takes the two classic forms of implicit and explicit expression. 
Whereas a vulture of the implicitly favoritist variety does 
not influence the course of events leading up to the material 
dead that it spectates, its counterpart favoritist does. In 
both cases, the favoritist vulture abstains from consuming 
the spectated fallen that it favored. Favoritist practices 
such as these fall in line with aspects common across many 
species, such as ape clans. Here is a speculative notion: 
if these kinds of vultures existed in resource-scarce 
environments, their livelihood would force them to discriminate 
less on what is available as their food. 

In environments ripe with favoritism, the spectated play into 
the presumptions of the audience rather than let pass a stunning 
upset to the partially sympathetic spectators. Given rules 
established at the beginning, the spectated's abidement of the 
rules is an entitlement to the spectators. The spectators, of a 
favoritist variety, do have other expectations borne from hope 
on their favored. Situations such as these are difficult to 
psychologically mollify. From the generic perspective of 
business ethics, "the customer is always right". To suppress 
favoritism is not in line with the wants and needs of all 
participants, especially the customer that is the spectator, 
of the situation. Suppression is usually frowned upon as an 
affront to individual freedoms and some idealization of apathy 
that could very well be a deep antagonism. 

The implementation of favoritism takes many forms. It is 
unnecessary to attempt to list the various ways favoritism 
is practiced. These kinds of allocated positive and negative 
influences target the mutable surface of variables, by varying 
degrees into the depths of their source control for outward 
expression. The concept of externally-sourced feedforwarding 
influence, found in the previous section Proprietary 
Calculations, is a competent template of visualization for 
how the spectator's wants and their corresponding actions of 
influence coalesce. The influence is left to be another 
one of those open questions, due to the lack of specific 
context. 

Not every situation welcomes an audience. The vulture may 
not be welcomed as a protectionist due to its favoritist 
leanings. It may not be welcomed whatsoever, despite what 
lack of discrimination it poses. Some games, intriguing to 
the areas of statistics and predictive analytics, make 
themselves pertinent in these situations unwelcoming to the 
spectator. In the Game of Spilling Secrets, the vulture takes 
up the responsibility of a selective information broker. 

The tasks of an information broker, intent on benefiting 
through these acts, involve choice calculations, impossible 
to quantitatively formulate given a lack of information 
(additionally, the poor knowledge of precedent) and the 
operating environment that must be mapped into formats 
quantitatively operable. Once again, by some means, a 
balancing act of picking and choosing emerges, this time 
featuring the vulture as the revelatory star. 

Predictive analytics rests on the correct use of accurate 
information. Above of this applied usage, there are 
some general strategies the information broker deploys 
with the spectated. An <ins>implicating security-breaker</ins> 
is a rationalist approach used to open up protected areas 
of value. The bypassing or deterioration of defense allows 
one to reach the area once protected. The approach is 
frequently used in technical situations and as such, 
definitely goes by many other names. The uniting detail 
behind all of these situations is that the secured target 
is secure by a connectionist arrangement. Attempts to 
focus all efforts on a single exploit that is heavily 
guarded does not work. 

![image info](./images/taiv_six.PNG)

**TAIV6:** Any exploit that directly attempts to impact 
target $X_0$ fails. The black rectangle is the impeccable 
defense barrier for $X_0$. 

![image info](./images/taiv_seven.PNG)

**TAIV7:** $X_0$ is able to be exploited by going through 
$X_2$ and then $X_1$, two connectors. 

Suppose there is a piece of information $P$ that is 
cumulatively constructed during the course of a situation's 
events that concern a spectated group $G$. Information piece 
$P$ is designed and desired by $G$ to remain a secret known 
only to those specific members. $P$ consists of details 
connected to one another, such that the revelation of an 
arbitrary detail to an outsider agent, such as a spectator, 
has a non-zero probability of exposing another detail. This 
compromising arrangement results from the outsider agent's 
ability to channel the "negative reception" of the detail 
first revealed into an inquisitive force of pressure onto an 
obscure, distinct, but also connected detail to improve the 
outsider agent's knowledge base. 

![image info](./images/taiv_eight.PNG)

**TAIV8:** $X_0$ is the spectated group, in possession of a 
secret piece of information $P$. $P$ is composed of an 
arbitrary $n$ elements, $I_0,\dots,I_{n-1}$. When $X_0$ 
reveals an element $I_i$ to a spectator $X_1$, $X_1$ 
transmits $I_i$ to its co-spectators $X_2$ and $X_3$. All 
three of the spectators then apply force onto $X_0$ for 
the next $(i+1)$'th element of $P$, by use of forcing-function 
$F$. The pattern of information flow, desired by $X_0$ to 
remain a secured secret, illustrates deployment of the broad 
strategy, termed implicative security-breaker, to obtain $P$. 

Another broad strategy of interest to distributors of capital 
information, brokers of sorts, is <ins>preventative security</ins>. 
This strategy depends on the compromise of a quality belonging 
to an agent, and this quality is a backward dependency to a 
checkpoint wanted to be attained by the agent at a future point 
in time. The term "backward dependency" has been mentioned in 
the section Arguments in Image-Projectable Contexts. That specific 
section places the term in the role of a target to be disrupted 
for an executing process' wanted failure. Backward dependencies, 
of preventative security by information brokerage, take forms of 
differing qualities to those of that section. Information is 
a catalyzer for action in this section, rather than the only 
constituent for the object in question (the argument in 
section Arguments in Image-Projectable Contexts). 

![image info](./images/taiv_nine.PNG)

**TAIV9:** Table displays a spectated agent $S_1$'s choices 
and those choices' effects in a situation where an information 
broker applies pressure onto the decision-making of $S_1$. At 
every timestamp $i$, $S_1$ can act by $a^{(i)}$, or refrain 
from taking the action in order to defend the secrecy of 
the set of information $\{x_j\}$ by function $\mathbb{D}$. 
Failure to defend the secrecy of each timestamp's specific 
set of information may result in the corresponding effects 
of the next column (third). The projected effects vary from a 
negative value, by function $\mathbb{C}$ inflicted upon agent $S_1$, 
to nullification of a previous action taken, and the fourth 
column shows probabilities of these effects' actualization. 

Preventative security is taken by some particular types of 
information brokers to ensure that some actions cannot be 
taken by their target. Pressure is applied onto the target, 
so that their decisions are greatly influenced by the necessitation 
of either guarding their secret/s, or proceeding along with 
the action that they would have taken if there was no external 
and aggressive pressure geared against them. 

The information broker's use of these two strategies, 
implicating security-breaker and preventative security, run 
converse to the actions taken by the spectated. The vulture, 
as this kind of information broker, is a protector not for 
the well-being of the spectated. It is the main agent in 
the Game of Spilling Secrets; the secrets belong to the 
spectated, most unwelcoming to the vulture. This particular 
game becomes very complicated when the spectators, all 
vultures, are not strongly allied with each other. The 
concept of weakly-connected alliances, a fair term for 
vultures not beholden to a solid alignment, was described 
in the section Shifty and Shifting Alliances Pt. II. 

![image info](./images/taiv_ten.PNG)

**TAIV10:** Diagram illustrating the construct that one 
vulture $X$ is confronted with in the Game of Spilling 
Secrets. The vulture uses a mixed strategy of implicating 
security-breaker and preventative security with the spectated 
$Y_0$. Implicating security-breaker is denoted by $X$ sending 
a query $Q$ for information $I_j$, through the starting point 
of information $I_i$, with the response (possibly null or 
fallacious) from $Y_0$ as the expression $R*$. For preventative 
security, the information of $Y_0$ deciding to act by move 
$A_i$ or defending the dependencies of secret information from 
exposure ($\mathbb{D}$) is sent to vulture $X$. $X$ is 
faced with the multi-decision of transmitting these two 
forms of information from $Y_0$ to its co-vultures, 
$V_1^{(-)},V_2^{(+)}$, and $V_3^{(?)}$. Each co-vulture's 
superscript represent its predominant alignment with the 
central vulture $X$. The decisions of these vultures help 
to determine the outcome of their possibly knowing $I_j$, 
as well as what the active measure of $P_{sec}$ (alongside 
$X$) amounts to. 

Each vulture in the Game of Spilling Secrets has to 
make decisions for a situation similar to that of the 
central vulture $X$ in diagram TAIV10. A mixed-strategy 
of the implicating security-breaker, used to reveal wanted 
information of the spectated's secret information, 
and preventative security, that which uses 
catalyzing informatic measures direct or indirect in 
impact, is what is required of the vulture to maximize 
the force it can conjure, by the use of the preliminary 
constituent, the information of the spectated that the 
spectated desired to be kept secret. Without the use of 
technical notation in line with standard computational 
theory, the complexity of these balancing acts the vultures 
decide on do oscillate in the confines of extremity, these 
confines entirely dependent on the actual information and 
capable actions belonging to the spectated. 

This is a game about adversarial control. In this section, 
its description does not contain constraints such as rules 
placed on the spectated and the spectators to preserve the 
strong division of labor, and the scope of harmful activity 
the vulture could be a part of. From a quantitative perspective, 
description of the Game of Spilling Secrets lacks the 
form of algebraic/economic rigidity found in simpler 
decision-making situations. Attempting to add quantitative 
definition to this game requires multi-layered algebraic 
expressions (i.e. chained-inequalities, sequential matrices), 
for use as decision-making operating environments. 

In this next paradigm, the vulture is a protector of the 
spectated. By some twists of alignment, these creatures now 
take the side of the spectated that need their actions and 
information kept secret. Security of information transmission 
is the central task for the vultures. There is the issue with 
consistency of information quality transmitted from one to 
another. Another issue deals with the outward transmission of 
sensitive information from the protectors of a spectated group 
to outsiders. 

![image info](./images/taiv_eleven.PNG)

**TAIV11:** A typical verification scheme that uses the 
principle of consistent echo (recollection). The spectated 
agent $Y$ conducts an act that is processed by both $X_0$ 
and $X_1$ as information $I_q$. Agent $X_0$ verifies that 
its "perception" is accurate by querying $X_1$ for accuracy, 
by use of $V(I_q)$, and $X_1$ sends its response on the 
query as $R(V(I_q))$. $X_0$ transmits its version of $I_q$, 
as $T(I_q)$, to $X_2$. And $X_2$ ensures that $T(I_q)$ 
equals $I_q$ by cross-checking the information with $X_1$. 
Both $X_0$ and $X_2$ conducted information consistency tests 
on $I_q$. For the question of the source of $I_q$, whereas 
$X_0$ is a direct witnessing agent, $X_2$ is a narrating 
agent. 

![image info](./images/taiv_twelve.PNG)

**TAIV12:** Valuable information $I_i$ is to be kept 
secret by $Y$ for security concerns. Anytime $Y$ is 
queried by an adversarial agent (green nodes), $Y$ 
responds with information different than $I_i$. Sending 
$I_i$ to $X_0$ results in $X_0$ sending it to other 
adversarial agents. If enough adversarial agents know 
what information $i$ is, their offensive against $Y$ 
and its allies would be more effective.  

Information-protectionist schemes are essentially 
cryptographic practice. Defensive competency by the 
principle of cumulative layering is standard practice. 
Vultures, as protectors of the spectated, are divided 
into three main categories. The first is the witness, 
the second the verifiers of the information relayed 
from the witnesses, and the third is the arbitrary 
defensive system to guard against an adversarial 
outsider's acquisition. 

![image info](./images/taiv_thirteen.PNG)

**TAIV13:** A layered information-protectionist design 
by the vultures to protect the spectated $S$' information 
$I$ from adversary $A$. Every green node depicts a class 
of vultures. After the verifier-vultures $V_v$ initiated 
the first encrypted layer over $I$, the remaining classes 
of vultures, $V_d^{(1)}$ through $V_d^{(n)}$, add more 
encrypting layers. The objective is for $I$ to be 
unrecognizable to $A$ from their initial receipt of it,
and continue to be unrecognizable by them after their 
efforts to discover what $I$ really is. 

The idea is that even if $A$ is able to get past each 
of the obfuscating classes of vultures, $A$ will never 
reach $V_v$, the verifier-vultures, let alone $V_s$, the 
spectator-vultures. Every class of vultures operates in 
a contained manner with respect to members, and 
compartmentalization of classes is code of conduct. 
The adversary could use something called an <ins>inquisitive 
force</ins> onto a class of obfuscator-vulture $V_d^{(i)}$. 
$V_d^{(i)}$ would send the information $I$ as  
$E_{i+1}(\dots(E_1(I))\dots)$.  
After successful application of the <ins>inquisitive 
force</ins>, $V_d^{(i)}$ would be forced to reveal $I$ as  
$E_{i}(\dots(E_1(I))\dots)$,  
the information that they were originally given as 
input. 

The vulture, as the protector, in this brief abstract 
of standard cryptographic practice, is far from how 
the literal vulture operates. But information security 
practices could mean to protect a spectator of sorts, 
including the possessor/narrator of information and 
the devices responsible for containing that information, 
so this description of the metaphorical vulture-protector 
is a fitting analogy for activity in that realm. Like the 
Game of Telephone, very well-known in many areas of the 
modern world, regardless of the area's technological and 
cultural prestige, vulture organization into cryptographic 
configurations may not produce the security intended. 
Sometimes, there is a big gap between the information 
deemed valuable, to be heavily guarded, and the security 
of the sentient being or place that information pertains 
to. Maybe the mystery of the unknown information, or the 
information presented in differing forms such as through 
encryption or gossip, sparks the right kind of outrage 
to pose real harm, especially if that information is 
not directly related to ensuring security of some form. 
When it comes to over-reliance on sentient beings in 
protectionist schematics, some may not be qualified 
to obey a prescribed quantification scheme. Quantification 
could fall short of predicting chaos reactive from 
some kind of information reception, and that information 
does not have to be the truth. In the grand order of 
protectionism, there are economic costs attached. There 
are power dynamics and contingencies to be maintained. 
And there is the literal creature, the vulture. 

## About the Simplicity of the Cycle <a name="p21"></a> 

The conceptual cycle has produced some phrases made 
classic after having found their way into common dialogue, 
discussion, and other kinds of linguistic expression. For an 
encouraging remark, try "maybe next time". For a rationale on 
what is believed to be justice exemplified, "that is karma" and 
"what comes around goes around". For telling another what they are 
in the totality of existence, "know your place in the circle 
of life". For admitting to the consequences of a bad decision 
or events outside of one's own control, "it is a cyclical 
downturn". The conceptual cycle is perceived as simple, yet 
robust enough to account for the many unexpected disappointments 
and the stories of triumph after rebirth. There exist beliefs 
in it as the prime component, the core, of deterministic 
perfection, unbreakable conservatism, and rule of human 
choice (a part of unbreakable conservatism in the socio-economic 
realm). The spans of available choice, in general, do coincide 
with expansions and recessions in capital and the state. Those 
proponents of free will, subject to these choices, would 
probably prefer abstinence given the degree of said choices' 
poorness. Mating games for many species are also cyclical due 
to seasonal preferences. Relentless dedication that results 
in more perfection than not is usually not without a scientific 
awareness of the methodology for cyclical improvement. The wheel, 
the cog, and the circuit are all materializations of the cycle. 
In more subjective contexts, such as in faith and the natural 
order that many human beings believe to be the one/s pre-ordained 
to govern, the cycle in these abstracted mentions lacks scientific 
proof and practice. The capability of commanding wheels, cogs, and 
circuits is not the only determinant in controlling the all-superceding 
cycle, believed to be the dictator of any thing that can change through 
the thing's existence, yes? But yet, there are still some that stand 
by the cycle as justification for whatever lack of control they 
have, or for what contentious actions they have taken. The preferential 
practice of cyclical routines is due to, by some degree, the 
practitioner's belief that they can achieve the closest possible 
to the infinite, an unquantifiable and godly value, by acting 
in the image of the infinitely-spinning cycle. 

Employing the cycle as the explanation for events, "big" or 
"small", that transpire out of causality, along disjoint spectrums 
of variance, means that the cycle is understood as a 
<ins>localized-mutative effector</ins>. A cycle can exist in a 
greater cycle, or run its course as a cycle distinct from another's 
events and/or variables. The events of a sequence, for the 
progression of a construct's development, do not have to retain 
identity that passes prescribed similarity tests with another sequence, 
in order for the two sequences, judged as distinct, to be regarded 
as identical cycles. The cycle of one process can produce more than 
one product. A cycle can produce multiple products through a single 
iteration. By the quality of localization, a particular product 
attributed to a cycle could be a product of another cycle. The other 
cycle could be a super-cycle to that cycle, or be a predominantly 
disjoint cycle except for the sharing of attribution in that one 
product. There is both consistency and inconsistency in the cycle 
then, due to its capabilities to localize (change in concentration 
and scope from a parenting super-cycle) and to change in metrics of 
outward appearance and effects, both immeasurable and not. This 
paradox is not with a uni-objective explanation, for the mentioned 
cycle of these contexts is mentioned because of the perception, 
resting on background and presumptive knowledge, that becomes 
rationalized into that of a judgment on the cycle as the one 
explanation for possibly many shades, scopes, and established 
causes. There is due to be opinion on the individuality of the 
cycle: materializations of the cycle into forms such as wheels 
are inarguably distinct, due to the process of exemplification 
from the source to the crafted material, but the methodology of 
separating the cycle from the remaining whole bears high risk of 
erroneous demarcation. The all-superceding cycle cannot be traced 
or shadowed to such degrees that total control over it can be achieved. 
But that is not the great irony. Arguably, the great irony is that 
offsprings of this all-superceding cycle can be used as contentious 
explanations wrongly claimed to have the same believed omnipotence 
as the all-superceding cycle, for events comprehended as facts or 
opinions. Another great irony is that if the all-superceding cycle 
cannot be traced or shadowed, how can the truthfulness of claims, 
regarding its unbreakable conservatism and rule, be verified? The 
claims take a believer then. But then again, cognitive analysis by 
choice and capability does rest much on belief. 

Frequent results from involvement with a cycle place said cycle 
as a key <ins>hypnotizer</ins>. On a intersecting field to hypnosis 
is the cycle's role as a <ins>derecognizer</ins>. The documentation 
of psychological practice and experimentation is not the aim of this 
work. Hypnosis is not viewed as scientific by many, due to its 
probabilistic actualization of wanted effects in recipients that 
have undergone sessions of this. A recipient to these practices' 
wanted results would have to accept the experience after forgoing 
their inhibition. So there is the question of voluntary choice 
that is the prime piece of proof for controversy. Hypnosis 
seeks to harness the plasticity of the mind, in the sense that 
the "wiring" of activators and propensities are modified towards 
satisfying the aims of the subtle commands enmeshed in the hypnosis 
session. Opponents of hypnosis, whether applied onto themselves or 
the overall practice, would call the results of "successful" hypnosis 
"textbook manipulation". A more convincing argument for the cycle to 
be recognized as a hypnotizer and a derecognizer exists, and this 
argument uses analyses of the cycle's effects on memory. The 
mechanisms of memory are difficult to explain in some cases, such 
as of human memory. By associating the quality of memory with 
recall testing in areas such as frequency of occurrence and recognition, 
and also in confidence of memory authenticity, the perspective that 
the cycle produces effects of some nature onto memory can be reasonably 
reviewed. 

![image info](./images/asoc_one.PNG)

**ASOC1:** A cycle with one head, $q$, and two additional 
checkpoints, $\hat{q}$ and $q_0$. 

To be a hypnotizer to a subject, the cycle could present itself as 
an entity with elements separate from the subject. The subject is 
not involved in the process/es that run the cycle, and their place 
is of a third-party observer to the cycle. After some number of 
iterations, the observer discovers the cycle to be composed of a 
head and some number of checkpoints before the cycle terminates 
back at the head. The observer's memory recollection trains them 
to recognize the cycle by perceiving the head, and each of the 
checkpoints in their iterative sequence. Expectations are adjusted, 
from the beginning of lack of expectation towards the certainty 
that a noted element of the cycle will occur some increments of 
time later, due to the occurrence of an element that the cycle 
passed at a previous point in time. The cycle could alter its 
appearance to include additional elements. But the observer would 
conserve their initial full-memory of the cycle, with the head and 
some number of checkpoints, so as to ignore what additional 
elements are added from one iteration to the next. Then the 
hypnotizer has accomplished the objective of fixing the 
observer's cognition to those elements of their initial memory. 
In contrary alterations, the cycle could alter itself by removing 
certain checkpoints that the observer holds in their initial 
full-memory. A successful hypnotizer would force the observer 
to correct their initial full-memory to the "most accurate" 
full-memory of the cycle. The cycle could be altered to be composed 
of just one element, the head, and the observer's cognition 
would make them think that that is all to the cycle in their ongoing 
observation. The cycle used as a successful hypnotizer would 
train the observer's cognition so that the observer would be 
able to attribute each iteration of the cycle as the identity 
of the cycle. Although there can be alterations to what a cycle 
consists of, as long as the observer recognizes each iteration 
that they observe of the cycle as the cycle's identity, then 
the hypnotizer has produced lasting effects on the comprehending 
mechanisms of the observer, with respect to the cycle and its 
perceived iterations. Derecognition is present in this account 
of the cycle with its possible alterations in its iterating 
forms. The observer fails to recognize the changes of features 
and/or effects of the cycle from one iteration to the next. 
To the observer, the cycle remains as the cycle, and the changes 
that bring themselves into and out of the existence of the cycle's 
iterations are simply anomalies. The design of the cycle does 
allow for anomalies. Confusingly, the cycle is a deterministic 
construct, deterministic by the hypnotized observer's perspective, 
that allows there to be non-deterministic elements of features 
and effects. One principle of the cycle, as a concept retained 
in cognition, is relevant enough to note. The cycle needs 
to have had only one past iteration, and this iteration can 
either be witnessed directly by the observer or be retold to 
the observer. After the passing of this one iteration, the observer 
that begins down the hypnotized path becomes insistent on 
recognizing the next iteration of the cycle and, in this pursuit, 
derecognizes details that they find to be superfluous or 
counter-argumentative to the cycle. 

The cycle's hypnotic and derecognizing capabilities also work 
from a first-party perspective. Without being granted a holistic 
view of the cycle, the subject of the cycle is to uphold other 
responsibilities of two varieties: stationary and mobile. Stationary 
responsibilities require the subject to be actively engaged in 
efforts for procedures of an arbitrary number of checkpoints in the 
cycle. Mobile responsibilities treat the subject as an input variable 
into the cycle. At each checkpoint in the cyclical flow, the subject is 
responsible for conducting activity that is usually prescribed, in 
a degree relative to the degree of determinism belonging to the 
cycle. Instead of gathering knowledge of qualities, in the 
spatiotemporal sense, on the entire cycle for achieving correctness 
in third-party observe-and-predict tasks, the first-party subject's 
cognitive processes fit for what comes before and after (stationary), 
or the specific tasks derived from prescribed responsibilities (mobile). 
The first-party subject's direct influence in the workings of the 
cycle economize their attention and efforts for direct application, 
via work, that could lead to an ignorance of the entire pattern and 
set of principles behind the cycle they are a subject in. The 
concept that connects the modus operandi of a hypnotizer and that 
of a derecognizer is "attention". Dedicated and concentrated 
attention from either the first-party or third-party subject is 
exerted, and these two classes of subjects are divided on the 
basis of two primary premises: the localized area/s of the cycle 
their attention is latched on to, in the manner of magnification, 
and their actions in relation to the cycle (observation & anticipation 
& prediction, or observation & anticipation & required work to fulfill 
cyclical iteration). Cycles that decline in effectiveness as hypnotizers 
and derecognizers inflame transient notions of doubt on determinism, 
and the terminal breaking of effects turns those initially 
transient notions into central foci of reflection and meditation 
for clarification. 

![image info](./images/asoc_two.PNG)

**ASOC2:** A cycle $C$ with five nodes, $[1,2,3,4,5]$, and a 
distinct cycle comprised of an arbitrary $P_X$ connected to $P_A$. 
$P_A$ establishes an input-output functional relation with $C$. 
This ongoing relation can act as a point for questioning the 
"identity" of cycle $C$, since $C$ has five critical points 
and one of those points acts as an entry point, a possible 
origin of $C$'s alteration, to an external cycle. 

![image info](./images/asoc_three.PNG)

**ASOC3:** A group of nested cycles, such that the fourth cycle 
is the super-cycle containing the other three. Every point on 
an arbitrary cycle represents an event of qualities and 
occurrences that forms a part of its whole. Two attempts are 
made to correlate points of one "distinct" cycle to another. 
The attempt, in blue, is a linear angular approach (in the 
geometric sense). And the other attempt appears to be a more 
arbitrary one that uses non-disclosed correlation functions to 
map a point from one cycle to the next. 

While both diagrams ASOC2 and ASOC3 are merely incomplete 
and generalistic attempts to depict cycles, they do encourage 
thoughts that lead to a few issues in cognitively processing 
cycles. The issues on identification, preference, and 
recognition in these cyclical schematics are a continuation of 
the discussion on the cycle as a hypnotizer and derecognizer. 
ASOC2 asks the question of how $C$ should be identified: purely 
by the occurrence of the chain $[1,2,3,4,5]$, or can $C$ still 
be $C$ after allowing there to be inputs of a questionably 
external cycle? Is the cycle to be identified as a strict 
sequence? What use is its identification if it is a simple 
abstraction that allows for wiggle-room, such as enabling the 
merged activity of another cycle and beyond? What scientific 
rigidity exists for a cycle to remain as its initial identity 
after undergoing some arbitrary magnitude of change? How can 
the preferential criteria for identifying a cycle be "evolved" 
over time to maintain the achievement of a balancing act between 
preserving the authentic identity and accounting for change 
spurred by spatio-temporal specifics? For these questions' 
answers crafted to suit judgment regarded as objective, the 
answers first require the full acceptance of the cycle/s as 
valid structural process/es. There is the dedication of acknowledgment 
and attention already, even if the only efforts that come out 
of answers are passive and resigned acceptances of the cycle/s. 

Diagram ASOC3 shows a set of nested cycles, and this nesting 
lends credence to the notion of factual hierarchy in these 
cycles' relations. Maybe a cycle's attribute of being nested 
in another is the big condition of the cycle's subservience 
in control and influence to the other. Maybe the super-cycle 
is a governing player in a Game of <ins>Constant-Concern</ins> 
to its sub-cycle/s. Identification and correlation are oftentimes 
contrarian to one another. Correlation is part of conflationary 
reasoning, and identification goes down the path of observing 
infinitesimal uniqueness between candidates. 

As already stated, hypnotic-like decision making, especially 
one that falls under the formulaic structure of a cycle, 
consistently depends on recognition mechanisms that intend 
to output identification of pre-determined values. When future 
events of one span are denoted as a particular cycle, the key 
identifying features of that cycle are observed in that span 
for occurrence. The rest, of variants and extras and negations, 
should be derecognized under the hypnotic state. In verification 
tasks, the belief is that the methodology works, but one iteration 
of the methodology may produce differing values. The cycle is a 
stabilizer that should not be changed. The cycle exists for a 
reason. Its use to produce the values that orbit it, the core, 
need to be ranked as second priority if the use to produce is 
really an objective. Run the cycle over and again, until the 
desired product values emerge as results. 

Some more notions are fit to be mentioned about alterable 
cycles. Diagram ASOC2 makes for a preliminary example on the 
mutative cycle. The two concepts of decline and death can be 
a part of certain cycles. The default cycle is a perpetual 
entity. Once it is set into motion, its design independent 
from external forces does not let it cease motion. Suppose 
a subject first enters a cycle. Then at a checkpoint, the 
subject ceases to proceed to the next checkpoint, instead 
exiting out of the cycle into another. If the subject is 
the only one that has entered the exited cycle, the cycle 
ceases to be relevant and thus dies. The subject is a 
<ins>cycle-breaker</ins> of an agent then, for themself 
first and by their possible status of being last, against 
the cycle. The non-constant cycle can also shrink. In ASOC2, 
if the connection of node $5$ to $P_X$, the entry point 
into the other side, results in a long-running imbalance 
of flow out of the five-node cycle $C$, $C$ will shrink 
by some variable rate, and eventually terminate in motion 
and existence. Circular reasoning for the existence of 
cycles does little to aid in understanding why this 
phenomenon can occur. There is the common perspective 
that a terminated cycle is part of a greater cycle's planned 
steps. So great is the greater cycle in its determination 
that once its steps have been planned and put into motion, 
there is no determinism that can produce anything other 
than those steps for the foreseeable future. 

Back to the topic of the individuality of the cycle, the 
design of a particular cycle could be suited to produce 
inputs for another cycle. A chain of connectivity could be 
an instrument additionally attached to a group of cycles. 

![image info](./images/asoc_four.PNG)

**ASOC4:** A group of cycles. Every red or blue line 
represents a connective flow of select products from 
one cycle to the next. 

Cycles can be demarcated into individual identities, 
but with the addition of a connective chain for a group 
of cycles, their individual identities mean little for 
individual values. The engineering of vulnerable systems 
for output, such that the components are preferred to be 
ignored in rank of value so that precision-based tampering 
is not as encouraged on the blackbox's functionality, 
demands a security that blurs any real demarcation. 
The connective chain is part of the super-cycle over 
the connected cycles. On what exactly is the cycle, 
individual recognition becomes a problem with answers 
of unscientific explanations, component-wise. A piece 
can be demarcated from the whole. But for some reason, 
it does not work when demarcated. And the whole has too 
many pieces to be given the sole identity through innumerable 
functions attributed to it. Oh, these localized-mutative 
effectors, these cycles. 

The cycle is one of the cornerstones of scientific 
methodology: trial-and-error as cyclical iteration 
for wanted products that can be reproduced by the most 
accurate cycle of methodology. With phrasing that 
directly associates "error" with "trial", positive 
expectations of these methodological practices are 
halved. The objective of <ins>purely gainful value 
transfer</ins> from trial-and-error operations must 
have risk of failure. The cycle of trial-and-error 
for discovery is usually run in a localized zone. 
After the discovery, the most accurate cycle is 
practiced in other local zones, maybe in a "global" 
zone. The best cyclical methodology from trial-and-error 
is still a localized-mutative effector by its conception, 
however perfect, and is also usually modified to some 
extent for every application of different localities 
and globalities. Some cyclical methodologies cannot 
be so easily mutated,externally, to account for 
distinguishing traits from one applied setting to another. 
What necessity to run the methodological cycle, regardless, 
requires the marginalization of the distinguishing traits 
in the representation of the input, in effect marginalizing 
the surface of disapproving attack on the cycle. 
<ins>Pathologically-perceived inputs</ins>, inputs that 
would be misapplied by a particular cycle of methodology, 
can nevertheless be inserted into the localized-mutative 
effector. And then what. There is bound to be error from 
the cycle onto the input and maybe beyond. The particular 
cycle should not have been run but, by some volition 
probably self-claimed to be righteous without challenge 
if not for the judgment of its pathology by the results, 
the input was processed by it; the input acted as a catalyst 
for <ins>falsely-caused firing</ins> of the cycle. In 
the case of the finiteness of a noun to be used as input 
into a methodological cycle, the expectation of high probability 
of failure from the input demands false copies of the input 
to be used instead in the trial-and-error discovery. An 
uncertainty of success remains after the cycle has been 
corrected to the most accurate cycle, to be applied onto 
the real copy of the input. 

Some particular arrangements of a dark light, phrased as 
the well-known <ins>Faustian bargain</ins>, also have a 
place in this discussion on cycles. The recipient of a 
Faustian bargain pushes for the deal of acquiring or fulfilling 
some thing. After there is that ideal granted to the recipient, 
the recipient experiences second-thoughts and unwanted events, 
all the while holding onto the product of the bargain. They 
think, because the ideal was initially too far away that 
they had to first experience and do certain things not fit 
for association with the product, then the ideal is no longer 
such since the consequences of those things' unwanted occurrences 
have inflicted changes in the shade of permanence, and what is 
left to enjoy is a begrudging mismatch. They could also think, 
because the ideal they sought was expressed to them in the 
past by select-hyperbolic fashion, the ideal cannot be a pure 
good when it is certainly more than those primes expressed in 
exaggeration. They go on thinking, to have reached the ideal 
and finally peeled off the surface display of the ideal for 
hopefully enjoying the ideal is a finalized bargain most 
regretful. Here are two diagrams for these thoughts, in order, 
left scant to preserve the honor by hiding the shame of 
all those that have fallen victim to these bargains. 

![image info](./images/asoc_five.PNG) 

**ASOC5:** The green circle is the natural setting of the 
ideal, with the ideal denoted by the red dot on it. The blue 
circle is the experience of the one before receiving the 
product of the Faustian bargain, through the exchange denoted 
by the black line. 

![image info](./images/asoc_six.PNG) 

**ASOC6:** The larger-than-life projection of the ideal leaves 
after substituting itself with the ideal of actuality. 

So the ideal sought after in the Faustian bargain is part 
of a cyclical process that preserves its value, and the 
recipient of this bargain wrongly believed that they can 
be only positively connected in direct relation with the 
ideal, after exiting their own cycle into the cycle of the 
ideal. The Faustian bargain, as illustrated by cycles, serves 
as a competent example of differentiation between cycles, 
by their separate effects that should not have merged. 
The recipient of the Faustian bargain wrongly believed that they 
could merge their existence with the ideal, found in the other 
cycle, to finally achieve ideal living. And third-party 
observers conclude, without direct experience as evidence, 
that the recipient was incompetent enough to be blind to 
the merging forbidden, out of the unnaturalness, of two 
cycles best kept separate, although all that these observers 
could objectively perceive were events and losses, not the 
cycles themselves. The observers could probably conclude 
that the recipient of the Faustian bargain entered a 
<ins>doom-cycle</ins>, constructed with the forbidden merging 
of two cycles, but that is merely their theory if that is 
all to their commentary's thesis. 

A technique, out of genuinely bad trickery, is given the name 
<ins>false-accounting cycle</ins> in this section's mention. For 
this variety of cycle, an event of some cyclical process is claimed 
to have occurred by one party to another. The claimant party 
lacks the evidence for the claim. So they construct an 
alternative cyclical process, and inject input from the base 
cyclical process into the alternative cyclical process. The 
alternative cyclical process is designed to produce effects 
in the likeness of the claims made, at least in the effects 
of the occurrence if not the occurrence. The other party does 
not know that any alternative cyclical process was used, 
and they are faced with the decision to believe in details 
not verified to have been associated with the base cyclical 
process. 

The possibilities found in diagrams GBGD2 (underminement, 
section Wasting the Drive in Gridlock) and GSA (Game of 
Sliding Alliances, section Shifty and Shifting Alliances) 
are of helpful reminder in understanding the complexity 
of alterable cycles. 

In applied theoretics of cycles, the subfield of physical 
offendors' use is a popular mention due to historical 
occurrences. And in virtually every instance of offendor 
success by use of the cycle, the opposition did not adapt 
for timely results of defense to the style of offense that 
felled them. By priming their specific methodologies for 
immediate lethality at every opportunity, there remains 
no chance for opposition's learnability of the problems 
most pressing to them. The cyclical offendors' effectiveness 
in elimination is because they kept oppositions' notions of 
them so broad and seemingly aimless, by fully taking 
advantage of their greater mobility into secrecy until the 
point of contact with the ill-prepared opposition. After 
what remains of the opposition past the initial point of 
contact within a span, the opposition struggles with a 
balance disheveled. The opposition usually expects there 
to come another point of contact, of time nearer or farther, 
from the cyclical offendor. But the opposition does not 
manage to formulate better tactics out of their strategy. 
So for proceeding points of contact, they oppose with their 
original mechanisms, with a disheveled and declining 
balance that has already ensured them lower potential of 
performance. 

Many moralistic viewpoints have been expressed on the 
matter of the cyclical practice turned malicious against 
the other entity/ies. Viewpoints are now noted in 
general and pseudo-precise echoing. Of foremost prominence 
in the themes expressed by viewpoints is the judgment 
that there was a mistake, or plenty of mistakes, somewhere 
along the way for there to be this physical offendor's 
malicious utility of the cycle. Without the feel to 
mince words in this retelling, there is the belief that 
there is a mistake that corrects itself by correcting other 
mistakes, through control by techniques including containment, 
deprivation, forced role-playing amongst other forms of subjugation, 
as well as the broad field of terror tactics with tools of physical 
violence or undetected harm designed to be perceived as non-violent. 
For each mistake and the entity of that mistake, the separation is 
not there for them two, in order for them to be one and the same 
in the match-up between the physically cyclical offendor and the 
opposition. Ponderance on the total from any one of the two 
halves is already limited by the bondage of allegiance. 
So what if there is/was a mistake on one end acknowledged by that 
end, for they are to keep that acknowledgment to themselves, 
by the terms of their bondage. No authorization exists from 
either end to the other, for the other to issue non-destructive 
corrective criticism. Any attempts of this sort of criticism 
is rejectedly responded back by those that first invoked claims 
of hurt to their own cultural and other group-based forms of 
unity through bondage. The distinct ways of life are different 
because of the reason of choice and conviction, carried out in 
the duration of time's accumulated effects. There were attempts 
to unite for one economy of differences in one will's singularity. 
But that cannot be so. "Agree to disagree". "Make due with the 
differences". Statements of non-belligerence turned into icy 
guards, on one hand, and a patience of insatiable hunger, on the 
other. And then, the antagonism is pre-determined once commenced, 
a blind cycle liberated by the careless killing of gravity. What 
accountability? Whatever happens happens then, even if the 
cycle dies for it is the ideal that stands after death. Sure, 
the weaknesses of inequality from difference could have been 
fixed beforehand. There was knowledge of what strengths needed 
to be achieved. But those efforts would have broken the way 
of life, the ideals, and so, there is that. 

Description of the problem of cyclical offense the opposition 
is forced to confront ensues. Deprivations unique to each of the 
two cycles are put aside by their own practitioners, of great 
dissimilarity, for long-awaited confrontations. The opposition 
is faced with one big decision on adapting to the physically 
cyclical offendor. They can choose to mirror or to wall. If 
they are to automatically choose the route of mirroring, they 
must attempt to surpass the performance of the physically 
cyclical offendor if they have not in the present. "To beat 
them at their own game, so as to humiliate them for our upheld 
honor". If they are in such a position as to be beholden to 
stationary practices, their drive to become more mobile is 
very difficult at the beginning of their efforts. And time 
is of the essence since their adversaries have commenced 
their offensive. Their forecasts of achieving this mirroring 
are almost entirely incorrect. The objective of putting aside 
their "natural" way of life for this mirroring is consistently 
protested against in internal affairs. There are big 
challenges in this mirroring. The physically cyclical offendor's 
practice is already perfected, by relativity metrics. And the 
opposition's mirrorization process means to train in an image 
at least partially prescribed, with the only real objective being 
the capability to counter the executable strengths of their 
adversaries. It is a decision of catch-up that balances with 
surviving legacy and custom. Such hardship in this adaptation 
route. Maybe with the wall, the physically cyclical offendor 
cannot push forward by their unique strengths excessive in 
relative magnitude. 

![image info](./images/asoc_seven.PNG) 

**ASOC7:** A diagram that shows the two broad strategies 
(mirror and wall) that opposition $O$ can employ. Maybe $O$ 
uses both in a mixed-strategy. Physically cyclical offendor $F$'s 
frontal assault, $A_{front}$, and retreat-to-base, $A_{retreat}$, 
are illustrated by the green arrows. Opposition $O$'s mirror 
approach is in dashed lines. If $O$ goes by the wall strategy, 
$O$ remains stationary in the hopes that the advancing $F$ 
fatigues themself before breaking through to the other side 
for direct confrontation. Both $O$ and $F$ have bases for 
their operations. Typically, $F$ tends to change their base 
more frequently than $O$ does.

An ill-prepared opposition that is positionally scattered 
across a field does have a greater chance of repelling if 
not defeating the physically cyclical offendor. But the 
greater chance is greater not necessarily in the absolute, 
but as a relative to the lone chance. This is simply due 
to the "many heads" the opposition has. The physically 
cyclical offendor that is effective takes at most two 
attempts to defeat opposition at a position. With one 
"head" down, there are that "many heads" minus one left. 
One aspect the physically cyclical offendor relies on, 
for effectiveness, besides from greater mobility and 
immediate lethality is the <ins>false-retreat</ins>, 
a technique made convenient by the cyclical nature of 
travel they take. The false-retreat fools the opposition 
into believing that they have successfully warded off 
the physically cyclical offendor. Here is an example of 
a prideful remark, spoken too early, from a spectator 
of a false-retreat: "look at the deserters flee away, 
the cowards, the disgrace that they are". 

The Game of Mirror or Wall, as illustrated in ASOC7, 
featuring a physically cyclical offendor and opposition, 
is not one for a trivial opposition. An opposition, not 
of any roughly equivalent forward-offensive caliber, that 
wants to conduct a frontal assault against an incoming 
frontal assault from the physically cyclical offendor 
will be crushed. If the opposition retreats from their base 
by sluggish mobility, the physically cyclical offendor 
could very easily catch up to them and crush them. If 
the opposition wants to conduct a frontal assault on the 
offendor's base, the offendor would still crush them by 
advancing after they did, and beating them in direct 
confrontation. If the opposition goes by the strategy 
of the wall, they would have to ensure the wall can 
endure the offensive. Also, there would have be open 
routes, not accessible to the offendor, remaining to 
the opposition for supplies. 

An opposition that is initially stationary belongs to one 
cycle. What they choose to do, after whatever decisions 
they have made to make an offendor out of a physically 
cyclical entity, arguably breaks their cycle of routine, 
even if they chose to not adapt by mirrorization of 
the offendor. The physically cyclical offendor, no 
matter their sheer power, operates by energy-intensive 
means. Their means are for the purpose of immediate 
lethality and accomodating mobility for that lethality, 
a purpose of ephemerally fatal offense. This kind of 
offendor dominates by their mastered hypnotic trance of 
violent engagement, a style heavily reliant on the rapidly 
paced patterned decision making that inflicts lethality. 
Just as hypnotized states borne from effective hypnotizers' 
application can be broken, the physically cyclical offendor 
can also be, as farfetched as this analogy reasons to. 
So certainly, there are instances where opposition used 
strategies of walls and mirrors, and bested the physically 
cyclical offendor. 

Sometimes, the opposition unanimously fails. And then 
accountability would make claims of leadership issues. 
Here is one frequent claim that has been seriously 
entertained. The social order proved to be insufficient 
after the declaration of ideals. Certain individuals' 
interests were betrayed before the beginning of the 
conflict, and those ramifications overshadowed those 
individuals for decline before collective ruin, even 
after they forgave letdowns of them. Now this is 
not a good basis to begin with before the conflict. 
Here is a common feature of physically cyclical offendors 
that were effective. The cycle, even after opposition had 
learned it to the point of effectively countering it 
at local scales, continues its targetted domination by 
birthing traitors out of the opposition. The mirror strategy, 
with its drive towards the likeness of the adversary, does 
carry this risk. Here is a common-sense saying: there 
is loyalty, and there is bondage. 

There are cycles of nature not easily exploited by 
sentience. Sentient design and corresponding use of 
cycles prioritize the recognizing of patterns over 
details, the correlation over the uniqueness, and the 
incredulity of what uncertainty the singularity can 
offer. 

## Shifty and Shifting Alliances Pt. III <a name="p22"></a> 

The theme of "alliances" in change-prone environments 
deserves a third section dedicated to it. Expanding past 
the incomplete discussions on possible graphical units 
available to model alliances, alliance factors ranging 
from single to multi-connected, a game on a particular 
alliance pattern, and the probable insufficiency of alliance 
factors in the numerical sense, the discussion now 
shifts to more specific techniques involved in alliances 
not of constancy. 

The word "alliance" operates on social-based arrangements, 
despite the perception of any alliance's order or organized 
chaos, both mathematically imitatable. Scientific principles 
can be attempted to be set into place to ignite and 
persist alliances. There are methodologies to estimate the 
best mechanisms available, by selected variables available, 
to produce alliances between particular sentient entities. 
Methodologies also exist to attempt solidification or 
liquidation of alliances in a wanted timespan. Methodologies 
cannot be used to produce intangible or inherent variables 
deemed important, without there being at least changes in 
sentient will proportional in radicality to the rarity of 
the intangible or inherent variable. The condition of the 
previous statement does presuppose many notions, such as 
predisposition not necessarily being the constancy of particular 
outward expression. And perhaps these variables are the 
most valuable, what with the systematic production capabilities 
of sentience that can achieve past a relevant minumum threshold 
of competence. Therefore, many methodologies involved in the 
activity of birthing and maintaining alliances come after 
those things recognized as facts, and a notable proportion of 
these recognitions easy to destroy and impossible to accurately 
replicate in any timely manner. 

Subjectivity is an interesting aspect of alliances. Participants 
of an alliance chose, through some majority-based procedure/s, 
to pursue the objective to "unite" by some degree for some 
activity/ies. In other words, they set that objective as the 
"truth" to aspire towards. This section's mention of the word 
"subjective" demands clarification. For some statement or material, 
there is a lack of agreement between sentience capable of judging 
its truth value, although it could actually be an <ins>unestablished 
fact</ins>. Questioning, reflection, and reconstruction of topics 
with implementation that is already of a high performance, according 
to specific metrics, is how subjectivity can be wielded as a 
tool for a challenger entity with an agenda. For example, a veneer 
of the subjective label can be placed over a noun not universally 
accepted as a fact. The subjectivity is there so that every sentient 
being that has a keen interest to involve themselves in the 
judgment of the noun's truth value holds onto the belief that 
their contribution's judgment matters. In some cases, the 
finalization of the judgment process is delegated to a small 
proportion of all those involved, in such a way for there to be 
a final judgment on the matter that was already "pre-determined", 
"pre-determined" because the decision was already accepted as 
fact before the proceedings of the total involved by their 
various mannerisms of analysis for judgment. Invoking 
subjectivity on a matter can be due to the cause of the invoker's 
lack of capability to independently act on the truth, whether 
to counteract or make use of by adoption. Processes that somehow 
transform subjective matters into belief systems believed by 
an alliance to be the objective (the truth?) are a priceless 
staple of the alliance's modus operandi, from core to execution. 
If the topic of shifty and shifting alliances required only 
one sentence for its cause, the sentence would satisfy by 
including the notion that the predominant cause is breakdowns 
by disintegration of agreement over the subjective/s, in 
unequivocating ways. That is elementary. 

An alliance surely has to use concocted definitions at its 
inception, to be maintained or changed or discarded throughout 
the alliance's lifespan. Definitions, by the fact that their 
factuality is below the purity of facts, but representations/ 
expressions/ forms of facts and other elements along the spectrum 
of truth, place the alliance as a group with pivots through their 
selection. The breadth and depth, of what is expected by each 
participant of an alliance with regards to co-participants, 
is variable and the uses of setting quantities to qualities 
for the rule enables behavioral patterns to emerge. A behaviorial 
pattern can be divided into individual actions taken by each 
participant of an alliance, and the knowledge of such patterns 
serves as the first primary step towards comprehending the 
complex, contradictable, and physically removed effects of these 
patterns by permutatorial (participant,action)-pair attribution. 
An alliance's collective risk assessment of their capabilities 
and actual executions is a crucial aspect of discussion between 
their members. Strategies that members employ rely on tactics 
such as <ins>risk-dumping</ins>; by the perspective of valuing 
the identity (the alliance, a subset of the alliance, et cetera) 
over the other, members regard risk-dumping only as intuitively 
gainful if they are not required to explain any further. What 
makes risk-dumping so impactful, other than its affinity for 
application on zero-sum variables, is that it cannot be 
unequivocally categorized as a group-extrinsic outflow, at least 
according to the collective agreement of what the group is by the 
sentient participants. And by the lack of categorization, 
any alliance's usage of risk-dumping techniques, usually resting 
on mathematical principles for profiting of sorts, cannot 
be expected to abide by constants for constant effects, when 
natural laws do not have the inherent expression to restrict any 
possible decision in the dealing of risk. Although the statement 
does read to be obvious and another way of noting the lack 
of collective certainty when coupled with actionable notions of 
independent agents' "free will", the likeness is actually not 
entirely exact, but rather an implication that focuses on 
the autonomous' dealing with possessed risks through disconnective 
transmission (full transfer from one to another) and acceptance. 
For participants of an alliance, the fair distribution of the most 
accurate marks in risk assessment is also not guaranteed to be 
constant; an argument for the opposite as the predominant form 
of this information's distribution is actually more convincing, 
given practices historical to present. 

The classic concept of the weighting scheme was put forth in 
the second part of Shifty and Shifting Alliances. The concept, 
with its many insufficiencies, does still discriminately serve 
the purposes of its proponents and opponents, alike. The constant 
is a localizable categorization of a matter's monotonicity. Users 
of risk-dumping techniques typically focus on the stabilization 
of their states and processes. For a little more clarification 
on how stabilization could be enacted, suppose that the states 
and processes can change, by allowance. But then, other factors 
such as capabilities and values are to remain in a satisfying 
range, so that the undergoing of change in those states and processes 
continue to serve at least one ultimate aim, arbitrarily-defined 
in this generalization. This generalization also works as proof 
for why participants of an eventful alliance would acknowledge, 
sometime during the course, that the definitions they used to erect 
the alliance are in fact concocted, although perhaps not by their 
own efforts. In other words, the definition could be expressed 
for the need to establish a basis of fact. The expression of the 
definition's expression takes forms that include imitation, reaction, 
and contradiction. So if the fact behind the initial definition, 
a product of select expression, is already beholden to favoritist 
interests, how can what follows after the initial be one and the 
same to the fact? The previous is an obvious factual chain, and 
does read silly out of its obviousness akin to the lack of need 
to remind. 

Denunciations of alliances, by arguments on their lack of an 
arbitrary constant, are insufficient for their rejection. 
These kinds of denunciations place the requirement of the lack 
of motion onto the alliance, in order for that alliance to be 
one satisfying to all members. The requirement, from the pure 
and absolutist sense, is unreasonable. Alliances do change in 
appearances and behavior, despite what definitions are adopted or 
continue to be adhered to. And that poses occurrences that demand 
attention to the differentiating labels of "shifty" and "shifting" 
for alliances. 

Risk-dumping techniques are carried out in two main areas. An 
executable objective is: 
- assigned, with an associated estimate of risk attached, by an 
  alliance to a subset of the alliance participants to attempt, 
  or 
- wholly abstained from by the alliance. 
  
The destinations of possible failure intended, by the selection of 
one of these two areas, are (in respective order) the subset of 
the alliance's participants and no participants of the alliance. 
Attempts to curb the non-null probability of certain risks' adverse 
effects rely on more considerations than simple assignment. In 
terms of psychological economics, there is the fear of failure 
that dominates the choice towards the decision of rejection, and 
the gains unmet from that rejection is what is lost. There is 
also the loss from the positive action taken, as rejection of the 
fear of failure that turned out to actualize. Forecasts on each 
of these two ways mate to form the shadow over every decision 
junction an autonomous entity has to make in the path with 
non-absolute predictions in outcomes. This explanation pre-supposes 
that an alliance goes by the principle "not all eggs in one 
basket", a frequent rationalist approach that falls under 
risk-averse decision-making.

**RANDRISK1:** A diagram that shows an agent $O$ that is 
to accomplish an $OUTPUT$. The procedure to attempt this 
involves precarious conditions, denoted by the blackbox 
$RAND$. After getting past the $RAND$ processes, such that 
$OUTPUT$ is either accomplished or close to being accomplished 
with a high degree of safety, agent $O_2$ attains the value 
of $OUTPUT$ without having to do the bulk of the work that 
$O$ did. 

Diagram RANDRISK1 is an example of nonlinearity in payoff 
from risk to reward. Risk, in terminal forms, assigned to 
specific participants would mean that over the temporal 
course of events, where all non-zero possibilities are 
eventually reached, those participants have higher risk 
of termination. Allocation of risk to specific participants, 
on a constant basis, could prove to be a persuasive point 
for contention in environments that nurture challenger 
initiatives. In the second area of risk-dumping, for an 
entire alliance to abstain from something recognized as 
both risky and value-producing, the rationalist alliance 
must not have at least one of the proper capacity and 
capability. 

An alliance's utility of concocted definitions is frequently 
for constructive purposes; the definitions serve as units 
to build for their system of holistic and component-wise 
choice. Here is where the idea of passive control injects 
itself into the alliance's modus operandi. There is an alliance, 
and the alliance was able to persist by the unity of their 
participants. The alliance was able to make constructive 
uses of their chosen definitions for a system with possibly 
evolutionary capabilities. Very little sentiment for that 
which is not of the system, even the definitions for the 
system outside of the context of the system, is a trait 
of an alliance dependent on their system erected, while 
tending to interests vested elsewhere. Once a workable 
system is intent on acting in the accordance of the alliance's 
goals, the alliance is granted several freedoms. The 
alliance does not need to expend as much cognitive effort, 
in the manner of roundabout calculations and extraneous 
learning processes, on tasks that have been accounted for 
by working processes of the system. This is a form of 
automation, and is the premise behind the power of 
automation: passive control by the sentience in charge 
of administering that system, since the sentience does 
not have to be the direct actors for those processes 
delegated to that system. Then, at least there is the 
freedom of <ins>passive cognition</ins> for tasks previously 
worked on. The construction of the system, by concocted 
definitions, could lead to complications of the decisions 
in its utilization. What is designed to promote passive 
cognition on certain tasks could be used in semi-autonomous 
manner by participants that aspire towards exerting what they 
believe to be direct control on the matters of the system's 
application. 

An interesting technique, given the name "<ins>passive-
deconfliction scheme</ins>" in this section, is sometimes 
used by an alliance in their procedural functionings. Passive-
deconfliction schemes constitute a class of risk-dumping 
techniques, and could entail harm to specific participants 
of an alliance's use. These schemes are used in settings 
where there is the notion from the alliance that there is 
a threat. The objective is to guard the most valuable subset 
of participants in the alliance during this ongoing threat. 
The base move in these schemes determines the best candidate, 
of an alliance, for each action or agent of this threat. The 
candidate acts in the role of a neutralizer to their assignment 
in the pairing, and the pairing could be entirely neutralized 
in its duration of activity. The naming, passive-
deconfliction scheme, does sound fancy and unnecessary. What 
has been described on this concept is essentially a prioritized 
layered defense system, such that each "layer" is one or 
more participants of the alliance; the prioritized layers 
cannot cave in to the center lest the alliance concede. So that 
feature, by itself, is far from original. However, the phrasing 
of this concept implies some additional attributes to be clarified. 
The passivity of these schemes is guarding the active representation 
of the alliance; this does imply the alliance to undisputably 
have a hierarchy in these contexts. And the term "deconfliction" 
is used by the alliance to signify an innate benevolence forced 
to take active measures, possibly archetypal of malice, against 
a threat; stated goals are to reduce the conflict, for conflict 
to not spread. But the phrasing makes no mention of restrictions 
on participants' enjoyment of the conflict in pertaining situations. 

Passivity is a quality related to alliances, in more ways than in 
"conflict". An alliance's system construction and utility, by the use 
of concocted definitions, allows the alliance at least the freedom 
of passive cognition. There is no universal specification on what this 
freedom could mean for an alliance's benefits and losses. Debates, by 
the stance of nurturing complacency, are common settings for system 
analysis. A few common patterns are attached to systems use, in the 
practical field of resource management. In growth and adoption of 
materials and techniques not granted at the intrinsic level, the 
graphical pattern takes one of two general forms: the flat line and 
the upside-down V. Flat lines are one of those conservative ideals 
that are all virtually defied in the longevity of spatiotemporal 
challenges. For a particular system that is argued to persist in the 
way of a flat line, rhetoric attempts to persuade by noting the 
surviving ideals, outlooks, and practices that have continued on, 
whether intactly or through "evolved" forms, for the body labeled 
a system now to be associated with, in the same vein, the body of 
the past that was under a similar labeling. Passivity is a factor 
that presents itself through many variables in systems growth. 
Honest attempts to understand an alliance in the systematic sense 
must consider how passivity can "pull the strings" of the system 
that has supposedly gained strength through satisfaction of 
proposed system requirements. Two phenomena, growth and change, 
are the basis of operation for impactful game agents bent on pulling 
the strings belonging to a system. 

The concept of "pulling strings" is used to illustrate action, 
by either internal or external origins, through utilizing a system 
because it is an adequate metaphor for system usage, automation-like, 
after the construction and embrace of said system. Automation has 
already been mentioned in this section's description of system 
construction, specifically for contexts of group-based unity and 
decision-making, an outsized consideration in alliances. "Pulling 
strings" instead of acting by one's completely owned mechanisms is 
a form of passivity, by individualistic metrics. By the metric of 
satisfying unifying means for unifying interests, alliances are 
burdened by constant decisions to take the prescribed route, in 
other words, to adhere to and use <ins>due process</ins> for what 
is recognized as problem and solution, alike, for the one reliable 
solution is already the system that was erected on the premise of 
correctness, by practical merit and universal ideal. Acting by these 
prescribed routes of some system is inarguably passive. The impressive 
feats of accomplishing much, "seeing things through", all the while 
having to tend to an established system are the successful halves 
of results from "pulling strings". It is these successful halves 
from the totality of results that perpetuate conviction in upholding 
the system. Growth and change constitute bodies of activity that 
are quite meaningful to system adherence. Consider an alliance that 
currently has capability issues in acting by their prescribed formulae. 
And capacity issues, with regards to current participants of the 
alliance as well as accomodation of novel non-participants into 
alliance membership, make these issues more dire. Growing membership 
is not a top priority of this specific alliance; "holding onto what 
is dear" has already burdened their collective attention span. But 
the alliance cannot "forsake" on what demands and duties they are 
originally charged with.

**RANDRISK2:** Two members of an alliance, $X_0$ and $X_1$, 
have to serve demand $d$ from $X_2$. $X_2$ is not particular 
on the source of demand, but they demand that $d$ be met. 
Functions $S$ and $U$, between $X_0$ and $X_1$, determine 
the split of responsibility for serving $d$ and for their 
maintaining unity, respectively. The diagram is a step forward in 
exemplifying a possibility of diagram MCAF2 (Shifty and Shifting 
Alliances Pt. II). 

Some attributes are present in the supply-demand relation 
that is shown by diagram RANDRISK2. One is the lack of binding 
responsibility from $X_0$ and $X_1$ to $X_2$, an impediment to 
the alliance's acceptance of $X_2$ for growth. Neither $X_0$ 
nor $X_1$ are expected to be of a wholesome supplier to $X_2$. 
The splitting of responsibility between $X_0$ and $X_1$ is but 
one factor in the two's ongoing efforts to maintain unity. Unity 
is posed as a question to be independently reviewed by the two, 
and also debated between them. 

This specific alliance is also intent on maintaining a "monotonicity" 
in decisions to act, with aims for the expected and actual 
effects from these decisions to be predominantly one and the 
same. Here is one aspect where tasks of perceiving stability 
frequently occur. Being categorized as "stable" is the positive 
end of "monotonicity". "Monotonicity" is achieved by acting in the 
least contradicting manner, in reference to the rules and 
procedures of a system. "Monotonicity" may mean to disregard 
calls to hasten due process for timelier results, or to delete 
or add elements for improvement to this system. Consistent use 
of mechanisms in the alliance's internal setting is a mark for 
monotonicity. Dichotomizing the workings of the internal 
setting (active representation of the alliance) and the external 
setting (other participants of the alliance, affected 
non-participants) is a balancing act, and results are advocated 
to be measurable along monotonicity metrics. "Monotonicity" is 
challengeable on the grounds of the lack of universal cause-and-effect; 
such lack is named "hypocritical" by opponents. Suppose the 
alliance is faced with a growing concern from non-participants. 
These non-participants claim that they do not wish to antagonize 
the alliance. Their demand, as the growing concern, is not solvable 
by the alliance, due to a combination of resource limits and 
contradictions to the alliance's due process.

**RANDRISK3:** Programmatic function for an alliance $A$ that 
cannot satisfy a demand $D$ without breaking out of its 
self-defined monotonicity. 

Some idioms impose remarkable influence on matters of this 
kind of decision-making. One of them is something similar to 
"give an inch, give a mile", an absolutist belief on the lack 
of limits for the magnitude after any lone possibility is enabled. 
There is concern over the directionality of the course of events, 
transpired all due to some arbitrary degree of enablement, 
with respect to some thing. Objectives, revolving around abiding 
by this idiom, fall into one or more of these general categories: 
- recyclable enablement: reciprocated in some recognizable and positively 
  usable way. 
- nonconsequentially antagonistic: support does not directly result 
  in the nurturing of a relatively formidable adversary. 

<ins>Reneged deals</ins>, in forms such as <ins>pathological 
supply</ins>, are frequent decisions made by alliances, out of 
the actuality that took place to deter the alliance from finalizing 
the deal, from proposition to agreement to satisfaction. Reneged 
deals defy the expectation by deliverance of the expectation's 
lackluster alternative. Pathological supply primarily works by 
substituting parts or the entirety of the deal with something 
existent. Economically, the substitute tends to be cheaper 
(not as valued by standard valuation). The pathological supply 
is to push the substitute into the role of a quasi-permanent 
alternative to the substituted. There are initiatives to 
"maintain the balance" of meeting the demand, the objective, 
through this primary route of a reneged deal. 

Identity is a hefty topic of discussion in alliances. Equations 
could be posited in mathematical form, but the more simplistic 
variations seldom suffice anything but simplistic statistical 
demands. So there then is the question of preference for the 
simplistic in practical matters, which becomes a discussion about 
culture, ethics, and material values. Quite subjective and 
lengthy for any meaningful discussion that can borne practical 
novelty and insightful revelation. Here is another subjective 
matter. The <ins>unity fiasco</ins>. What is not the same to 
something at the beginning can questionably become different to 
its self and very much the same to that something. And what 
is not different at the beginning can questionably become 
different to its self and very much different to that something. 
Acceptance is a necessity in the incorporation of these two 
possibilities in unity. The unity fiasco occurs when there 
is just no way for some things to be accepted. These things 
can change over the course of time to satisfy the expectation. 
These things can retain their original identity. But there 
is just no way but conflict if those things are to be positively 
elevated. Essentially, compromise cannot be ever reached in 
these situations. The coupling of unity with fiasco describes 
the pathological and irrational propensities at play in wars of 
desire VS will. The unity fiasco takes place at a few important 
junctions in certain alliances. Alliances that are based on 
hierarchy have their own ways of ceding power from one participant 
to another. On the one hand, there is the desire to retain the 
image of the predecessor. And there is also the reconciliation 
of differences in order to keep the form and function of the 
alliance intact. Such reconciliation could ironically demand 
a participant that would not keep the alliance's form and 
function intact. It is about the details of how, what, and 
when the form and function are no longer intact that seem to 
slip away into speculation zones for these most uniting 
points of alliance. 

Alliances, as organizations with their structural processes, 
can depend on a strategy named minumum-in maximum-out till 
termination (MIMOTT) for collective efficiency and conservation 
of the active representation. MIMOTT matches each participant 
with their "most fitting" role. The participants acquire the 
skills necessary to excel in the role, at a level much greater 
than their counterparts if the counterparts were to have attempted 
to do the same (maximum out). In hard terms such as temporal 
and spatial measures, these participants matched with their 
respective role cost the least (minumum in). One more condition 
is attached to MIMOTT, in order for the optimized input/output 
values to hold. The efforts that each matched participant take 
must not be constructive towards their breaking out of their 
matched role. Metaphorically, the potential of each participant's 
enacting systemic change is a stump instead of a tree. In 
mathematical terms, numbers in a structured form solve for 
MIMOTT's optima. MIMOTT may run contrary to meritocratic principles, 
simply due to the fixture of participants into roles. The 
participants may have actually opted for something else, to 
break free from their assigned responsibilities for 
responsibilities of a similar if not greater level. The 
optimal matching of MIMOTT is done only once. Over the 
trials of time, participant-role matchings may not be 
beneficial to the participant. For example, the participant 
has to do heavy work, but gets paid less than another participant 
that does not have to do any of the heavy work, only the 
accounting. In role-switching, the first participant would 
easily pick up on accounting. But the other participant would 
not be able to do the heavy work. There is a lack of dynamism 
that negates challenges to positions for possible lack of 
robustness in MIMOTT, a strategy that attempts to place excellence 
found at the beginning into permanence till termination 
calls for a new participant-role matching. Alliances that 
depend on participant-role matching, in any form, to satisfy 
their ongoing objectives may be vulnerable to a type of 
influence attack: the <ins>functionary-allocation attack</ins>. 
The attack's objective is the complete opposite of merit 
and efficiency in the placement of participants into roles. 
Serious effects from mismatches include stunted and/or 
imploded alliances. 

## Pride Plays Perception <a name="p23"></a> 

Perception somehow has to produce meaning. The lone memory, 
accurate in the short time after its birth, eventually fades 
away in the sense that recollection must work harder to 
reconstruct towards its fullness; the memory is no longer 
wholly withdrawn from a base into active cognition, and 
the active cognition has to process additional steps 
for that lone memory faded to be brought back to life 
in a distorted form. The descriptor "distorted" may be a 
disagreeable term to the recollector. The recollector could 
state that their recollection is, in fact, authentic but 
not wholesome. A differing perspective would counter that 
the recollection is not authentic because it is tidbits 
of what happened, and these tidbits are typically both 
most memorable and picturesque to be recollected for a 
supposedly accurate form. So there are questions of the 
recollection's wholesomeness, and the authenticity of the 
remnants that is the recollection of the memory now faded. 
Section How Obtuse Judgments Can Count contains slight explanation 
on the differentiating lines between perception and judgment. 
The ensuing discussion attempts to capture more explanation 
on perception, using conceptualizations of that thing called 
pride, and extending out of simple juxtaposition with the 
concept of cognitive "judgment". In this discussion, the 
conceptualizations of pride may actually outweigh perception 
in the lengths of their elaborations. The choice to use this 
theme to elongate discussion on perception is due to its real 
and far-reaching effects on sentience that can operate on both 
"individual" and "group" bases. From certain perspectives, 
the concept of "perception" is not confined to the one scope 
of external phenomena's effects processed by simple sense/s, 
for the resultant to be a feeling or memory. There would be 
only two aspects to discuss for this one scope: 
- "accurate" initial processing of the external phenomenon 
  via granted senses;  
- accurate recollection of the initial processing into 
  active cognition. 

There does not appear to be a universal formula or set of 
formulae for delineating "perception" from the factors that 
produce or influence it. However, the notion that competing 
formulae can serve as equally competent solutions for modeling 
this task is valid, by using claims that rest on the similarities 
of accuracies by select weighting schemes. "Pride" takes a 
high-ranking spot as a relevant candidate out of these factors. 
It contributes greatly as a motive to recognize or filter 
information. "Pride", taken up into individual or group 
cognition, deflects itself from its base word into a multitude 
of values for thoughts that are either internally secured 
(arguably labeled as "repressed" by certain cultures) or 
actionable. A lot of notions, sometimes presented as pure 
truths, have been put forth on "pride". The concept (pride) 
does make for an easy topic to denounce from a moralistic 
perspective. It is the number one sin out of the Seven 
Deadly Sins. Conversations on this particular concept 
sometimes lead to admissions of some kind of fault for 
the purpose of correction towards "balance". Other times, 
there is only the acknowledgment of such a force, and 
an underlying drive remains to forgo attempts to change 
activity, stemming from this force, via entire elimination 
of it from all levels of cognition. Dishearteningly, from 
a great number of perspectives, "pride" along with its six 
counterparts constitute unkillable forces very much like 
essential ingredients for a specific food recipe. Things 
would not be the same without pride. "Pride" is one of the 
more difficult of the seven to recognize by a universally 
accepted methodology. It splits itself into a multitude 
of values, intangible and imperceivable to external sources 
of sense. Unlike lust or gluttony, for instance, pride does 
not abide by such direct cause-and-effect patterns. There 
is hubris, the extreme variant of pride, that is easier 
recognized after events that fall under categories of grievous 
mistake. For behavior to be recognized as prideful, there 
is the need to rationalize a metaphysical backtracing path 
from the behavior to the intangible and imperceivable pride. 
"Pride" is but a subjective term in many analyses. The term 
can also be a derogatory label, usually given by an adversary 
of some sorts, for the agent of some behavior. This section's 
coupling of "pride" with "perception" uses conceptualizations 
that are relatively simple in quantification and visualization, 
instead of narrating over select phenomena believed by some 
to be representative of "pride". 

Pride, in the realm not necessarily to be entirely reserved 
to human beings but to sentience in general, is a motivating 
and controlling force before the perception, and a reactive 
force after the perception, despite how accurate the perception 
can be without any additional drivers connected to it (if that 
is even possible). Consider perception as not a default immune 
to partiality. On the converse, perception is an act attached 
to objectives that do not have to present themselves in such 
forward fashion. Objectives can be expressed in fashions of 
universality: "eradicate poverty", "war against drugs", 
"kill the corrupt", et cetera. The methodology that judges 
the objective as a singular expression, void of nuance, to 
be a rightful universal must be at most agnostic in belief 
to the possibilities, actualized or not, that constitute the 
means believed to be necessary to satisfy the objective. 
Critics of particular means would expectedly use words such as 
"blindness" and "perversion", very antithetical to the 
nobleness that objectives must carry to retain and perpetuate 
believership. There are some that argue that their own 
believed rightful universal is at least agnostic in belief, 
that they are willing to do whatever it takes to achieve 
their wanted marks of success. The rationale, on why the statement 
of the rightful universal is at most agnostic in belief, is 
due to the double-sided nature of progress and infliction; 
what is to be done to the other in the name of the universal 
cannot be done to the self, out of sanity. This is a rationale 
based on the reference of selflessness contrary to the opposite, 
the self with directed interests that would inevitably be 
called "blind" or "perverse" by opposition. Opposition, in 
general, does not have to be constrained to accuracy of perception, 
and this opens up possibilities for them to arbitrarily label any 
initiative as "blind" or "perverse", regardless of the initiative's 
strict reference to the self or selflessness. Because the reference 
of selflessness is not as concentrated as the lone self, criticisms 
tend to be geared against the "negative" (non-existence, negligence) 
marks of the selfless, which could then be defended by the selfless 
through their posit of no accountability or control. Criticisms 
of the self, the self being one that yearns for singular 
attribution, focus on the "positive" (failures through attempt, 
ignorance) marks. As with the absolute split of qualities found 
in typical dichotomies, this dichotomy of the self and the 
selfless, in the context of believable criticism, is imperfect 
and usable only as a preliminary metric for further judgment. The 
truth and the action do not run in forms parallel to each other 
according to a universally believed natural order, not when 
there are objectives by pride of the self, the group, and 
the selfless. The phrase "universally believed" is synonymous 
to collective sentient agreement, in this context. 

Perhaps these next statements are more than half-truths on the 
ramifications of "true" pride. The prideful operates by principles 
that they do not want to violate if they had the liberty not to. The 
prideful does not want to feel humiliated or belittled, and as such, 
tends to act in ways that do not risk their being put into situations 
that promote these dynamics. The prideful has an intimate and binding 
relation with their identity, in self and group forms. The prideful is 
a resolute and self-enduring entity. The prideful responds in unyielding 
tones to demands that they do not agree with. 

![image info](./images/ppp_one.PNG) 

**PPP1:** Two automata that show how "pride" and "lust" act. The diagram 
for "pride" is more open-ended than lust in a few aspects. One is that 
there is no way for the "pride" automaton to terminate. The agent that 
the automaton models can oscillate evenly between "pride" and "no pride", 
or preside predominantly at one of the two ends. The possible actions that 
"pride" can take are not shown in the automaton, only their orientations 
(pro,contra,?) according to an axis. There are no rigid definitions 
attached to "pride" or "no pride" in the automaton. The automaton for 
"lust" is more narrow in scope, and can act as a template for demonstrative 
testing of an agent for their possibility of being lustful. There is 
a way for the "lust" automaton to terminate: the agent has conclusively 
demonstrated "no lust". 

After the diagram PPP1 that models how "pride" and "lust" behave, a 
last statement on "pride" is in order: "pride" is a great mystery, 
in many of its forms, because the prideful can be unusually deceptive 
to accomplish their wanted tasks. Perhaps "pride" is not the word. 
Perhaps? 

The focus now shifts from incomplete illumination of the concept of 
"pride" to its influence on perception. "Perception" has not yet 
been abstracted into a logic structure in this section. A model for 
"perception" takes the practice to be extendable and reducible 
subspaces of total cognition; to clarify, total cognition includes 
the "sub-conscious", sensory input (commonly termed "perception"), 
the "feelings", the "ruminations", the "hypotheses", the "conclusions", 
and any other additional thoughts not encompassed by these quoted 
terms. An example situation for the perception logic structure's use 
is now put forth: 
1. A man with a clenched fist walks up to you. 
2. The same man throws a punch at your face. 
3. You duck. 

A competent perception logic structure for this example helps 
produce an information sequence in this likeness: 
1. Detect threat situation. 
2. Detect threat. 
3. Avert threat. 

The perception logic structure should immediately correlate (map) 
the clenched fist to a threatening sign of body language. Afterwards, 
this same structure should map the threatening sign to the 
actualization of a threat. In abstract terms, a wholesome perception 
logic structure has to map the raw input, collected by the 
senses, to what that raw input "means". Diction is at play in 
this logic structure's design. What that raw input is mapped 
to "mean" could instead be labeled the "judgment" phase of cognition. 
But another valid labeling for "judgment" would be the statement 
that the threat actualized needs to be averted. For this to happen, 
the perception logic structure should immediately map the clenched 
fist to a threat, and perception would have to heavily be in use 
for events of prolonged physical altercation.

**PPP2:** An abstraction of typical artificial neural networks, 
albeit with more "humanistic" labeling. There is the input, and 
$n$ layers of interpretative perception after the initial perception 
step $P_0$. Information from the $P_?$ layers are routed to a 
blackbox judgment function $F_j$ and then, there is judgment. 

![image info](./images/ppp_three.PNG) 

**PPP3:** The aftermath of the input processing from diagram PPP2. 
The specific judgment produced from diagram PPP2 prefers additional 
processing to be done via the route at head $P_0$ instead of $P_0^{(1)}$. 

Section How Obtuse Judgments Can Count mentioned two models, the 
perception-first and judgment-first models. Diagrams PPP2 and PPP3 
further illustrate those two. Judgment matters. In the continuity 
of sentient existence, judgment could very well come before perception 
at some points in time. It is the specific judgment that determines 
the focus (synonymously in this usage, the objective) of the perception 
logic structure. The sensory input into the perception logic structure 
could remain identical throughout the processing; there is no additional 
meaning to be gathered in this possibility. For additional meaning to 
be generated from the initial sensory input, there must be non-identity 
mappings that observe subsets or the whole of this input. 

Pride supposedly presents itself in some forms through all of 
this processing from sentience. For one, pride acts by certain 
cues, recognizes certain symbols more than others, and can act 
as a random-like self-driving force that propels objectives out 
of rational-like belief. These conjectured traits of pride all 
lead back to the identity of the prideful. In cases where there 
are differences in the sensory input, no matter how slight, two 
differing possibilities for a formulated judgment could lead to 
vastly different conclusions (final judgments), via derivation 
from different segments of the sensory input through the perception 
logic structure (equivalently, interpretation). 

The common notion that every decision bears effects, great or 
small, mean things in terms of the outcomes. In the real sense, 
these outcomes are the spatiotemporal details affected by decisions, 
through promotion or demotion. This notion opens up another medium 
for pride to inject its influence. The concept of situational engineering 
(an entire section has already been dedicated to the concept) is what 
pride can do, not independently but as a potent factor. Sources of 
perceptual processing are not necessarily stationary. Pride, as 
a determinant, in the decisions made then places these sources into 
spatiotemporal settings that otherwise would only have occurred 
through drivers other than pride but of similar wants. The 
interpretability of the lone word in use, coupled with diction 
that prefers one word for another likened as a synonym, incur 
difficulty on the perfect attribution of pride to a vastly different 
sequence of decisions forced to be taken. An analytical statement 
could be expressed as: if it was not for "pride", these events of 
these descriptions would not have occurred. Without further details 
that eliminate extraneous possibilities for a constrained context 
pertaining to this statement, substitute words for "pride" could be 
"ambition", "haste", "anger", "hate", and "love"; practically, 
any noun with a non-null scope of influence, with respect to the 
open-ended context, would do. 

In standard English dictionaries, "pride" has an alternative 
definition: a pack of lions. For continuation into another 
aspect of pride's coupling with perception, the condition of 
the being being the lion is extended to any sentience that 
operates by group-like principles. From theory to practice, 
metrics ascribed to the measurement of a pride are expected 
to output non-null values for the pride's tight-knittedness. 
Non-negligible factors are present in a pride for its members 
to continue co-relations not of a souring or soured tone, 
sweet only on the tongues of feudalists. This does appear to 
be an off-hand remark. The statement is derived from 
feudalism debatably resting on a sour centrality of goodness, 
by default. Pride takes shapes that convolute itself, quite 
frequently, with wrath and strength. This convolution 
demonstrates the difficulty of containing, let alone 
pinpointing, pride as the culprit behind some action taken 
believed to be the means appropriate, based on the judgment 
derived from the possibly long process of perception that 
led to the decisive interpretations for it. Tasks of 
identifying purity of metaphysical forces, as drivers for 
specific actions, is difficult to conclusively agree on. 
The use of "conclusively" is to signify the lack of any 
possible differing statement that is believable in 
presentation, not the lack of debate in the setting of 
deliberation. A pride united in perspective on a statement 
would not act on any motivation to debate, but the perspective 
is conclusive only to them. The social sciences allow "wiggle 
room" to independently extend the conclusion for some yet 
unconsidered purpose other than the retention of the original 
("pure") meaning. This poses one classification of complexity 
for pride's identification. And to recall on this section's 
previous mention of linguistic complexity, there is also 
diction and the lone word given new meaning under particular 
uses, outside of the default. 

A pride, taken to be a term synonymous with "group", has 
properties of tight-knittedness that cannot be conveniently 
manipulated by those not of the pride. The pride, due to 
both the lone autonomous capabilities of its members and 
each member's distinguishable identity, has the liberty 
of many faces. Even absolute uniformity becomes differentiable 
through tag-like identifiers and independent experiences. 
And the term "face" is not a strict association to that 
anatomical part of the human being, most distinguishable 
to the naked eye. The "face" has a personality, per se, 
with talents possibly of categories unique amongst peers. 
And these talents are evidenced through the work of the 
"hands". The "face" and the "hands" could very well be 
synonyms for one another, in group orders where appearance 
is submissive to the work. The tight-knittedness of a 
pride, intent on remaining a pride, does not concede 
elements that could be directly used or exponentiated 
for that pride's disintegration. Prides are vulnerable, 
and unanimously successful prides have great control 
over what continues to enable their constancy if not 
flourish. The concept of control is conventionally 
illustrated with physical apparatuses such as strings 
and chains, and in actions by effective grips and commands. 
Subservient relations are shown through these illustrations, 
and the directionality of effecting influence is 
predominantly from one source. 

An entity, not part of a pride, enters the setting of 
the pride. The pride appears to have more than half-like 
degrees of control over its domain, but the entity's 
perceiving of the pride's absoluteness in control is 
not there. The entity's intuition advances them into 
the pride's domain, for the objective that they believe 
feasible of wanting to accomplish an $n$ number of steps. 
And the entity discovers, after attempts to fulfill some 
of these steps, that their objective has been foiled. 
The pride was subtle in its control, and took active 
measures to not appear pro-active in its guarding 
against the planned $n$ steps of the entity. The 
entity had different inklings on the makings and 
workings of the pride's structure. Their higher 
hopes for achieving their objective can be visualized 
by probability distributions of a high score, well 
past the default fifty percent threshold. Those 
probability distributions are either wrong or 
irrelevant by lack of demonstration, undemonstratable 
because the entity's progress was cut short. The 
$n$ steps that the entity strove to accomplish 
was considered a peril to the pride. The pride 
used the strategy of a trap posed as openness 
to the entity. And the pride's livelihood continues 
on, after the success of the preventative measures 
against the entity that may have had involved 
the entity's termination. Alternatively, the 
pride could have attempted to blockade the entity's 
entry. The entity's perception of the pride would 
have been different. Descriptors for this perception 
include "closed", "close-minded", "hostile", "overly 
defensive", "unfriendly", and "xenophobic". The 
entity would have had to take a different series 
of steps to accomplish their original objective. 
But this, alone, does not reveal much on the advantages 
of a pride that is open, in the manner of a trap for 
potential threats, as opposed to closed. This is an 
example that could be used as an argument for pride's 
undefinable strengths by its autonomous practice. 
The autonomy of pride lies in its maintenance of 
the entity's perception, and thus their judgment, 
in their progress towards completing the $n$ steps. 
Judgment by the entity was off the mark and their 
perception of their surroundings for the objective 
laid out in those $n$ steps did not aid in correcting 
their judgment for the better decision of withdrawing 
or correcting their procedure. The pride controlled 
the entity's destiny in the span of the entity's 
activity in the pride's domain. What is a truth on an 
enduring pride, after the dealing with a threat through 
a combination of open and closed methodologies, is that 
the pride survives. But is that really representative 
of pride, by the first definition, or is the survival 
of any group (pride) under an identity all there is to 
pride as proof in practice? 

Is pride something like a business that can grow larger 
than its respective source? Businesses that were able 
to grow also tended to preserve their brand, their "image" 
and "values" as makings out of predominantly their 
independently adopted practices, per se. A category of 
alliance, on the spectrum of absolute adversary to absolute 
ally, is the <ins>gray-zone agent</ins>. This naming is 
only natural, in line with the classic black-white dichotomy 
that so much intellect has been dedicated to in the fields 
of ethics, cultural studies, reason, and religion. Out 
of the prideful prerogative to preserve the constructed 
"image" and adopted "values", many candidates that would have 
otherwise achieved much, for a pride, by first gaining 
acceptance into the pride are instead cast aside, like 
homeless dogs too domesticated to be as self-sufficient as 
wolves, like material for "cannon fodder" in a cold and 
barren world, prone to hostilities of monstrous forms and 
titanic magnitudes, outside of the pride's domain. 
Gray-zone agents are forced to operate by principles 
outside of the sentiment for the symbol, the status, and 
the affiliation, quite simply due to the design of the 
directional flows of gains and losses with respect to 
this agent category. Without sentiment, there are only 
such things as material goods, acts of gratification, 
and forms of bondage instead of the connection by 
genuine affection of loyalty. Ultimately in the 
economic sense, moral protests against gray-zone 
agents cannot produce permanent changes of their 
inclusion into a pride, without there being replacement 
or conversion in observable form. Gray-zone agents are 
an inevitable byproduct of the central product that is 
the establishment and legacy. In an attempt to further 
express this idea in the "language of poetic justice", 
the grayness reflected back from the gray-zone agents 
is the truth of the light that hits them. A scientific 
principle turned quasi because of application onto a 
category of social constructs. But the designing and 
directing of perception holds in stable or confirmed 
settings. There is a pride. The pride has this image and 
these values. Others can choose to align themselves with 
initiatives put forth by the pride, but the pride 
cannot let those others completely in, lest they 
change the image and educate the others on the ways 
of their values, efforts that could prove quite 
expensive in monetary terms alone. 

Inflation and deflation, two concepts studied 
extensively in economics and fiscal policy, are 
also heavily used by pride in its communicating 
of its self. Inflate the communication of those 
traits the pride believes to be the "positive", 
and deflate that of those the pride believes 
"negative". A pride willing to take their unfairness 
further would also apply inflationary and deflationary 
measures on the other in directions inverted to that 
what it does to its self. Where is the truth in this 
affiliation of pride with inflation and deflation, 
when it is pride that believes it can rightfully 
inflate or deflate? And it is not as if inflation and 
deflation are those two moves specially reserved for 
pride's use. There are objective identification issues, 
as already exemplified but not fully on pride. 

Can pride be operationally principleless? Structure 
cannot exist without principles. An unrevealing statement, 
yes, that intersects the meaning of "principle" with 
"structure". A sentient being, recognized as representative 
of pride, can still be representative of pride after 
disregarding a principle, either they themself stated or 
was noted by the other. But one transformation could lead 
to another. The prideful would be unrecognizable even to 
themself after bending and conforming their behavior, 
careless to their principles, for many transformations 
that take effect in internal mechanism of their self 
and external observation by their non-selves. The quality 
of pride being unyielding, noted in the beginning of this 
section, would be broken by all of this untempered 
transformation. Pride's counterpart, wrath, makes itself 
present in situations such as rapidly released energy, 
the temporary breaking of a principle, and wants 
repressed into a state believed by observers to be 
dormant and withdrawn. Wrath appears to be principleless 
by its lack of predictability from some observers. It is 
what the observers do not see, the negativity absorbed 
by wrath's hosts, and what the same observers choose 
to disregard as ramifications of what they can see, 
such as their untoward words and actions, that compose 
some of the most unpredictable wrath. If pride were really 
in charge, it is as if wrath is just another one of pride's 
sidearms. 

There is a common saying from those that have felt insulted. 
The saying is: "my pride is insulted". The concept of 
pride is already of dubious sense in exactitude. If the 
person that said this is actually prideful, in the sense 
that their pride is self-generated, they would not feel 
insulted. But if the person's sense of self in the context 
of their identity is believed to be defamed by the other, 
then they have the right to state that their pride (identity) 
was unrightfully given bad note, in defense of their pride. 
These are stylistic differences in the mention of pride by 
the supposedly prideful. Pride, that unkillable force due to 
its innateness and virality, is nevertheless practically finite 
in each of its hosts because the hosts themselves are 
under the scientific clause of mortality. Next is a question 
to end this discussion's examination of pride against its 
insults: how many poems and law books can be written for 
that most romantic and regretful chagrin, all because a 
pride thought it fit to fight fire with fire and poison with 
toxin, when it is the process of perception constituting the 
interpretation for that judgment call? To insult one's pride 
is to insult one's self, is it not? 

To walk with pride is to walk with confidence, an analogy 
that designates compatibility of pride with confidence, as 
if them two were meant to be until the world ends. Confidence 
has a statistical measure for it, although the measure is 
still numerically based, leading to the possibility of 
protests against the measure's use as true representation of 
confidence. Confidence is a predictive motivator. Behaviors 
are modified, farfetched possibilities then but now the ideal 
set as the objective, and other effects of cognitive changes 
are present with the elevation of confidence. The confidence 
placed in the hypothesis of the existence of something, for 
example, implicitly places demands onto perceptual processing. 
Thoughts such as the high chance of success and the great 
gains from that success modify perceptual processes, indirectly 
through the alteration of judgment. A judgment adjusted (any 
confidence) or skewed (false confidence) influences perception 
to note any information that has semblance to the actualization 
of what is to be done because of high confidence. Imaginary 
connections are drawn between tidbits of the entire information 
processed by perception and the expected that is the desired 
future, due to that high mark of confidence. Nothing can prove 
confidence wrong without error that kicks back with the 
impunity of natural law at work.  

## Pride Plays Perception Pt. II <a name="p24"></a> 

There is always something more to be expressed about pride. 
In this second edition, some more characteristics arguable 
as features of pride are presented and detailed. But the 
vast field of the intersection between pride, as a concept 
not entirely describable due to either inadequacy or inaccuracy 
of the transcription from the manifestation to the written word, 
and perception, quantifiable and simulatable but with individual 
experiences not replicable without fault, means this second 
edition will also fall somewhat short with respect to the 
grandiose of pride's role in one of the greatest paradigms 
for understanding, perception. 

The prideful unfulfilled in their self-belief, unaccomplished 
in their stated mission, and trivialized by their peers entertains 
the idea of feeling a sense of doubt after their cognitive feedback 
loop crashes. Praises turned out to be faked or mean little, 
reward systems all of a sudden upended, and the "promised land" 
was never met.
