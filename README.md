### The Big Principle: 
### In mercantilism, that "father figure" you have that told you "it is not about the money, it is about the principle" might just rape you dead and take all of your belongings...

Business comes and goes, much more frequently than governments. 
So how can commerce thrive without the dread of disillusionment
that stems from the lackluster payoff in zero-sum dynamics? 
Zero-sum dynamics carry an extremely bipolar nature in the 
psychology of actors. And there are few paradigms of thought 
outside of this zero-sum strategic convention in politics, 
business, and war. Well, to clarify, there are few paradigms 
of thought, outside of zero-sum, that have gained enough 
mainstream adoption for the concepts to be taught in typical 
higher education settings.

Brilliance does not quite make the mark in intensely competitive 
settings. But there are some that argue that it is the misuse 
of brilliance, trained and primed towards "malfeasant" outlets,
that results in clear defeats for the owner/s of that brilliance. 
But there have been and are plenty of brilliant people that 
did not quite train and prime themselves towards "malfeasant" 
outlets. And they get paid in dirt. The dumb and perhaps 
retarded scoff at their ideas, deny their promotion, and ruin 
their composure. This is how some brilliant people get treated
like dirt. They get invited to a club or party of some high-society
members, after achieving much and expecting some festive recognition, 
and the invites are rescinded. And the club/party mentions them as if 
they are some dull one fit for exploitation. The high-society 
members already know, due to the luxury and power that they 
are able to retain, that preventative measures against 
exploitation require more than just brilliance. Brilliance 
is materially less in value than dirt. The brilliant person 
wants to get somewhere, with rejection thrown in their face 
as well as insults and knives in their back, their so-called 
"defensive posturing" against exploitation is most definitely 
born from a source, or at least an effect, of malice. 

Do you really think that fat cow that is your neighbor really 
gives a care for your interests and well-being? Laissez-faire 
feudalism predicts that they do not. While you might be digging 
trenches for "modern-day Rome", that fat cow, the one that has 
never been hurt in any way except for their feelings, looks at
you like you are some kind of slave. The fat cow is stupid.
It is stupid not because it is simple-minded. It is stupid for 
judging while sitting comfortably in its welfare zone, sponsored 
by the government in the name of ... what? Merit? Justice? That
fat cow, ultimately in the context of economic sacrifice, may 
as well be a wolf. It may as well be a wolf because it would 
prefer that you are eaten instead of it.

Suppose there is some kind of wisdom in ultra-competitive 
environments, borne out of Laissez-faire, that goes something 
similar as "one should make as much effort in befriending 
another as the effort required to defend against an enemy."
This is an "ideal" that is much easier to declare and believe in 
than to successfully accomplish. The difficulty of accomplishing
this "ideal" rests upon the nature that surrounds the center, 
for there is no mechanical principle behind it that ensures 
the equal probability of easiness in befriending and enemizing.
Who is to state, with a guarantee that rests completely on 
confidence instead of fear, that not every person becomes 
an enemy in the eyes of a "neo-mercantilist" (for lack of a 
better term)? 

The notion of the fat cow as a wolf in the context of 
economic sacrifice is a strong assumption on costs from 
loss due to some underlying fatalism. Rest assured that 
there are many in academia and government that strongly 
disagree with the concept of competition, or at least 
self-improvement, as zero-sum. These contrarian views 
harness the game theory specification of "non-zero sum 
games". The rationale is that some aspects, which can be
quantified, rests on a sort of cooperation, a mutual 
assurance, a compromise. There is much opinion and 
exemplification on non-zero sum games. These so-called 
"games" do exist in reality, but were only formalized 
into theoretical frameworks, for re-teaching, sometime 
in the last two centuries. By the standard of non-zero 
sum games, the fat cow does not have to be a wolf then! 

The mechanics of "costs", including but not limited to 
quantitative finance, are derived from the cultural 
mores and collective ambition, but the "faith" in these 
numbers do not rest on a uniform consensus of agreement. 
For instance, a sentimental person would probably prefer 
to sell something else other than the memorabilia 
that they've acquired through their years. There is 
the belief in the pricelessness of some material 
objects. Collectively, these same material objects 
could very well be circulated by the masses, according 
to some arbitrarily-set standard of valuation, if 
they are to land in their hands. There are psychological 
and collectivist elements in non-zero sum games. Suppose
that two agents are participants in such a game. Given 
the perceived costs in this game's cost table, the two 
agents "cooperate" for outcomes that grant them both 
"positive" gains, by the table's objective numbers. But
there is dissatisfaction underneath the compromise. 
Perhaps either one or both of the agents feel as though
they deserve more of the "positive" gains. What factors 
would ensure that for the next "game" these two agents 
participate in, there would be no disagreement on the
values of said game's cost table? On the matter of 
collectivist elements in non-zero sum games, suppose
that two arbitrary agents are enthusiastic participants. 
Both of them are practically in sync, with regards to 
their decisions and the corresponding payoffs from those
decisions. But regardless of what decisions they made,
there is a "super-agent" above them. This "super-agent"
is the singular representative of the collective outside
of the game's two agents. According to the facts given 
to this super-agent, both of the agents lose in the 
non-zero sum game. The deceptively "positive" gains split
between the two agents are in fact losses to them. Perhaps
the gains could have been objectively greater if the 
agents were to participate in non-zero sum games without
the overhead of the super-agent's authority. Perhaps
the gains are not objectively positive gains for the
two agents in the long term, given the super-agent's 
influence and capability of intervening between the 
two. 

Cultural, psychological, and collectivistic factors 
were especially noted in non-zero sum games, even
though their existence in zero-sum games is not 
negligible. It is obvious to state that zero-sum 
games, if based on accurate cost tables, result 
in "cleaner cuts". Every participant has very 
little motive to consider the outcome of well-being
for their "competitors". Zero-sum games rest on 
the principles of physics. Value cannot grow, but 
it can be cleanly transferred from some original 
owner, a participant in the zero-sum game, to 
another. The argument that zero-sum games are 
more objectively-based than non-zero sum games 
is more persuasive than the argument for vice-versa.

There is an absolute chance for arguments that non-zero
sum games are more amenable to participants. And the 
claim that the base of objectivity is an exclusive 
trait to zero-sum games is surely to be scrutinized. 
There is another claim that can be more fully 
agreed upon: for any prolonged sequence of 
decision-making events, the usage of both 
game categories serve unique demands. The payoffs 
to participants from non-zero sum games may amount 
to less for each, in comparison to the potential 
payoff (single participant gain) from zero-sum games.
But over time, the partial payoffs from each 
non-zero sum game produce longer lasting and more
stable benefits to the participants, by the metrics 
revolving around uniformity and the mean. Needless to 
say, these two categories of games can be expanded to
involve more than two agents in the lens of mass 
organization. Organizations do not tend to encourage
zero-sum games between its members, given the condition
that both members are of pertinence, through utility, to 
the organization (but perhaps not of the same degree). 
The compromise from non-zero sum games suits the purpose
of pacifying such biases, including jealousy and ambition, 
for integrity of the organization. However, in an 
organization's life, there occur instances where 
zero-sum games are utilized for the objective of 
slashing what is deemed to be excess or vice. 

The first paragraph of this essay posits the 
domineering influence of zero-sum, over others such as 
the alternative of non-zero sum, as a concept taught
in the education setting. Many in university/government
settings would probably not be vocal in support of this
posit. Activities such as research&development, 
coordinated security, and journal publications do 
lean towards cost values of non-zero sum game. 
Knowledge, especially, is one of the fundamental 
possessions that do not operate on zero-sum dynamics 
on the one condition that the knowledge is fairly
distributed. One of the ideals espoused in higher 
education is something along the lines of "a more 
informed society is a superior society". But the 
value of knowledge wildly oscillates from trivia 
to critical vulnerabilities belonging to persons, 
organizations, nation-states, etc. What is a non-zero
sum game to a select group of participants may be
reflected onto another group as a zero-sum game's 
outcome that adversely affects them.

With regards to application of the concepts zero or
non-zero sum, the first is predominantly used in 
contexts such as material transfers and clear-cut
win/lose outcomes. Due to the cooperative nature 
of non-zero sum games, even with the specification 
that the participants do not know ahead of time 
what their counterparts' decisions are, there is 
a tendency for at least one of the participants 
to lose sight of the definition behind the outcome
values. The coupling (two participants) and 
entanglement (more than two participants) fuzz 
decision-making in such a way for there to be 
virtually no optimum payoff by the available 
options. Perhaps in some cases, contiguous 
non-zero sum games played by the participants 
may result for there to be a kind of "delegation"
from at least one of the players to the remainder.
The preferences of the remainder become prioritized
over the delegators, who would rather play and follow
along than to emphasize their own ideal choices 
in the "game". 

## Autonomy and Games

Autonomy is a multi-faceted question in arrangements 
that are games. Why would an agent participate in some 
arrangement called a game if there is the certainty 
that the best outcome, in the form of payoffs from 
the true cost table, cannot result in their betterment?
The agent diverges from their original circumstances
that would have granted them opportunities to pursue 
some desired sequence of outcomes, each a checkpoint of 
success or at least, gratification. Then they are 
enmeshed in circumstances that require their actions 
to be geared towards some objective directly related 
to the specific temporal demands of those circumstances.
They can mention the question of choice, a topic which 
is generally known to many members of societies that have 
had their hands forced into certain outlets (certainly by 
the mortal powers above them), but they will only receive
a response to accept the matter as another of idealism's
lost visions.

Children engage in activities that can be termed
as "games". These activities generally do no harm amongst
themselves, and give them the benefit of developing their
values and way of life to eventually play the roles of 
astute cogs in mature society. It is this premise that 
is a major moral justification for why some find themselves
in circumstances, deemed games by some, that they otherwise
would not engage in, either due to their ignorance that 
such circumstances (comprised of materials and events) exist 
or their involuntary stance towards those circumstances.
The premise as one word is education. Is this word 
simply a transmission of terminology and procedures,
as well as the auxiliary materials used to aid in 
understanding and experiencing this transmission of 
information? Could education really be as simple as two 
parallel straight paths, one the perfect transmission 
(by the educator) and the other the perfect practice or 
at least the most genuine effort in practice (by the educatee)? 

Entertain the notion that there are two tenets in education. 
For matters of fact, education transmits absolute truth. 
And for other matters, education transmits perfect knowledge 
of the methodology. This notion relies on the condition that
there is nothing to be educated on past the minds of the 
educators. The educators were selected due to their mastery 
of the matters that they are to transmit and train their 
educatees on. So the educators could not possibly steer
any of their subjects directly towards wrongful practices 
and fallacies. 

On the idea of autonomy as the choice to participate
in games that benefit and to not participate in anti-beneficial
games, education as outlined by the previous paragraph 
is beneficial. But in games that are believed not to be
beneficial, how can an agent truly know that they will 
sorely pay during or after their participation? Couple 
the particular outlining of education (in the previous 
paragraph) with active efforts to know the unknown (and 
all of the unknown's costs), from a perspective that supercedes
even the educator. And the resultant is not education by 
the definition. Instead, it is experimentation and education. 
Education systems can enable their educatees to experiment, 
outside of constraints designed by the educator.
There are certainly arguments available to defend these 
kinds of education systems, so that the educatees have 
greater awareness of what games will pay them off 
immensely, what other games are non-profit but greatly
expands the experience (if experience cannot be 
quantified), and yet still the remaining games that 
will make them sorely pay beyond their recovery back to 
growth or at least, stasis. 

The structuralization of any education system surely 
cannot accomodate the demands of the lifelong learner.
This is to assume that any education system imposes
binding demands on its participants. Without binding
demands, the freedom of participants to come and go 
by their own volition somehow dilutes the seriousness
and truthfulness of the informational material 
transmitted to them. In these circumstances, education
becomes casual recreation, and recreation is personally
experiential events; this is a Dionysian VS Apollonion 
argument. Even if one is not keen on learning any more 
past their depth, there is still the requirement 
of experience in sentient existence (if life goes on). 
And experience can be very stochastic, or even worse, 
engineered against those subject to the experience. The 
term "information-flow system" suffices as a superset 
of "education system". There are not required to be any 
binding demands from an educator that does not need to 
exist. The omnipresent requirement of processing 
information stands strong in this superset of an 
education system, even stronger than that of the 
education system since the lack of structured guidance 
is compensated by utter seriousness in certain contexts.

In many respects, the objective of education is to 
enhance and refine risk-averse mentalities and behaviors.
For example, mistakes from history should not be repeated.
Make careful calculations before embarking on dangerous
trails. Take the tragic lessons from literature to heart.
And so on. With experimentation, there is risk attached.
Experimentation is interesting with regards to 
accountability. Educators generally steer clear from 
the losses from experimentation. The simple more is that
they cannot risk their reputation to become entangled 
in what are perceived by third-party judges as fallibility 
traps. The fact that there are different natures and 
styles attached to those that experiment validates the 
anticipation that conceptualizations of fallibility, such 
as the Seven Deadly Sins, are to be mentioned by some in 
their aims to "reveal and penalize evil". 

Autonomy is intricately connected to information-flow
systems. Some important attributes of noteworthy mention
are filtration processes, recognition mechanisms, flow 
control, network administration, and ultimately, capabilities 
past the knowledge that is perfect information.
