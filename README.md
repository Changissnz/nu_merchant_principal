# Nu Merchant Principal

### The Big Principle: 
### In mercantilism, that "father figure" you had that told you "it is not about the money, it is about the principle" might just rape you dead and take all of your belongings...

Business comes and goes, much more frequently than governments. 
So how can commerce thrive without the dread of disillusionment
that stems from the lackluster payoff in zero-sum dynamics? 
Zero-sum dynamics carry an extremely bipolar nature in the 
psychology of actors. And there are few paradigms of thought 
outside of this zero-sum strategic convention in politics, 
business, and war. Well, to clarify, there are few paradigms 
of thought, outside of zero-sum, that have gained enough 
mainstream adoption for the concepts to be taught in typical 
higher education settings.

Brilliance does not quite make the mark in intensely competitive 
settings. But there are some that argue that it is the misuse 
of brilliance, trained and primed towards "malfeasant" outlets,
that results in clear defeats for the owner/s of that brilliance. 
But there have been and are plenty of brilliant people that 
did not quite train and prime themselves towards "malfeasant" 
outlets. And they get paid in dirt. The dumb and perhaps 
retarded scoff at their ideas, deny their promotion, and ruin 
their composure. This is how some brilliant people get treated
like dirt. They get invited to a club or party of some high-society
members, after achieving much and expecting some festive recognition, 
and the invites are rescinded. And the club/party mentions them as if 
they are some dull one fit for exploitation. The high-society 
members already know, due to the luxury and power that they 
are able to retain, that preventative measures against 
exploitation require more than just brilliance. Brilliance 
is materially less in value than dirt. The brilliant person 
wants to get somewhere, with rejection thrown in their face 
as well as insults and knives in their back, their so-called 
"defensive posturing" against exploitation is most definitely 
born from a source, or at least an effect, of malice. 

Do you really think that fat cow that is your neighbor really 
gives a care for your interests and well-being? Laissez-faire 
feudalism predicts that they do not. While you might be digging 
trenches for "modern-day Rome", that fat cow, the one that has 
never been hurt in any way except for their feelings, looks at
you like you are some kind of slave. The fat cow is stupid.
It is stupid not because it is simple-minded. It is stupid for 
judging while sitting comfortably in its welfare zone, sponsored 
by the government in the name of ... what? Merit? Justice? That
fat cow, ultimately in the context of economic sacrifice, may 
as well be a wolf. It may as well be a wolf because it would 
prefer that you are eaten instead of it.

Suppose there is some kind of wisdom in ultra-competitive 
environments, borne out of Laissez-faire, that goes something 
similar as "one should make as much effort in befriending 
another as the effort required to defend against an enemy."
This is an "ideal" that is much easier to declare and believe in 
than to successfully accomplish. The difficulty of accomplishing
this "ideal" rests upon the nature that surrounds the center, 
for there is no mechanical principle behind it that ensures 
the equal probability of easiness in befriending and enemizing.
Who is to state, with a guarantee that rests completely on 
confidence instead of fear, that not every person becomes 
an enemy in the eyes of a "neo-mercantilist" (for lack of a 
better term)? 

The notion of the fat cow as a wolf in the context of 
economic sacrifice is a strong assumption on costs from 
loss due to some underlying fatalism. Rest assured that 
there are many in academia and government that strongly 
disagree with the concept of competition, or at least 
self-improvement, as zero-sum. These contrarian views 
harness the game theory specification of "non-zero sum 
games". The rationale is that some aspects, which can be
quantified, rests on a sort of cooperation, a mutual 
assurance, a compromise. There is much opinion and 
exemplification on non-zero sum games. These so-called 
"games" do exist in reality, but were only formalized 
into theoretical frameworks, for re-teaching, sometime 
in the last two centuries. By the standard of non-zero 
sum games, the fat cow does not have to be a wolf then! 

The mechanics of "costs", including but not limited to 
quantitative finance, are derived from the cultural 
mores and collective ambition, but the "faith" in these 
numbers do not rest on a uniform consensus of agreement. 
For instance, a sentimental person would probably prefer 
to sell something else other than the memorabilia 
that they've acquired through their years. There is 
the belief in the pricelessness of some material 
objects. Collectively, these same material objects 
could very well be circulated by the masses, according 
to some arbitrarily-set standard of valuation, if 
they are to land in their hands. There are psychological 
and collectivist elements in non-zero sum games. Suppose
that two agents are participants in such a game. Given 
the perceived costs in this game's cost table, the two 
agents "cooperate" for outcomes that grant them both 
"positive" gains, by the table's objective numbers. But
there is dissatisfaction underneath the compromise. 
Perhaps either one or both of the agents feel as though
they deserve more of the "positive" gains. What factors 
would ensure that for the next "game" these two agents 
participate in, there would be no disagreement on the
values of said game's cost table? On the matter of 
collectivist elements in non-zero sum games, suppose
that two arbitrary agents are enthusiastic participants. 
Both of them are practically in sync, with regards to 
their decisions and the corresponding payoffs from those
decisions. But regardless of what decisions they made,
there is a "super-agent" above them. This "super-agent"
is the singular representative of the collective outside
of the game's two agents. According to the facts given 
to this super-agent, both of the agents lose in the 
non-zero sum game. The deceptively "positive" gains split
between the two agents are in fact losses to them. Perhaps
the gains could have been objectively greater if the 
agents were to participate in non-zero sum games without
the overhead of the super-agent's authority. Perhaps
the gains are not objectively positive gains for the
two agents in the long term, given the super-agent's 
influence and capability of intervening between the 
two.
