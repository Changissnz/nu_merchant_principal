# Nu Merchant Principal
## ~ ongoing notions by me, Richard Pham.

### The Big Principle: 
### In mercantilism, that "father figure" you had that told you "it is not about the money, it is about the principle" might just rape you dead and take all of your belongings...

Business comes and goes, much more frequently than governments. 
So how can commerce thrive without the dread of disillusionment
that stems from the lackluster payoff from zero-sum dynamics? 
Zero-sum dynamics carry an extremely bipolar nature in the 
psychology of actors. And there are few paradigms of thought 
outside of this zero-sum strategic convention in politics, 
business, and war. Well, to clarify, there are few paradigms 
of thought that have gained enough mainstream adoption for 
the concepts to be taught in typical higher education settings.
